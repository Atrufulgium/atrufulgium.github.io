        About the below replacements:
        - Long dashes are replaced em-dashes. Spaces around to not interfere with decrement operators in code.
        - The `<p>[]</p>` replacements are for custom bb-like tags that span their own line.
        - The `block` tag is one of those large blue rectangles everything except the title's written inside.
        - The `display-image` tag represents centered images.
        - The `sketch` tag additionally adds the colour filter on top. Your brush colour should be `#ffcccc`.
        - The `gap` self-closing tag is the small space between large rectangles on the main page.
          The `block` tag automatically gets one for free before it.
        - The `br` self-closing tag is a new paragraph. Intended for multiple paragraph footnotes, as kramdown
          ~~rightfully~~ does not support those.
        - The `href="##"`-erasure is to ensure hover syntax does not have whack results.
        - The footnotes replacement gives it a title.
        - The mcfunction replace is because rouge doesn't support mcfunction and I'm using another language in its place.
        - The shaderlab replace is because rouge doesn't support shaderlab and I'm using another language in its place.
        Btw, everything in here is in a huge HTML comment whose delimiters are liquid-comments.
        This is to ensure that syntax highlighting or autocomplete doesn't go *completely mad*.
        Now it's just the spellchecker not knowing wtf it has to do.

        There are also some replacements in `post.html` before markdown is processed:
        - To not have to remember the path to the repo every time, there is a REPO shorthand in urls.
        - To not have dangling <p> and </p> tags, some bb-tags are blockified.
        - The mcfunction replace is because rouge doesn't support mcfunction and I'm using another language in its place.
        - The shaderlab replace is because rouge doesn't support shaderlab and I'm using another language in its place.
