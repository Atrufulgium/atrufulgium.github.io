1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,920
<font color="#467546">I was dreaming just now,</font>

2
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:16,610
<font color="#467546">and I dreamt of an eye.</font>

3
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:20,300
<font color="#467546">Now, I forgot, I wonder...</font>

4
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#467546">Who am I?</font>

5
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:30,000
<font color="#467546">Mom, where have you gone? Dad, where are you hiding?</font>

6
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,421
<font color="#467546">That dream...</font>

7
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:36,279
<font color="#467546">I was up high in the sky.</font>

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,320
<font color="#467546">Falling into a red sea.</font>

9
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,178
<font color="#467546">There were these things all around me...</font>

10
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,219
<font color="#467546">And then, that eye...</font>

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,260
<font color="#467546">...</font>

12
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:47,709
<font color="#467546">I'm up high in the sky.</font>

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,750
<font color="#467546">But now, I'm not falling.</font>

14
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,791
<font color="#467546">I'm wide awake.</font>

15
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:57,256
<font color="#467546">Well, let's go.</font>

16
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,705
<font color="#467546">Towers are rising from the clouds.</font>

17
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,563
<font color="#467546">And these towers are old, and dusty.</font>

18
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:05,012
<font color="#467546">Wizards play with strings and wings.</font>

19
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:08,686
<font color="#467546">And they watch the skies, where no bird flies.</font>

20
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:12,768
<font color="#467546">If only I could see that through my own eyes...</font>

21
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:16,850
<font color="#467546">I once asked the wizards why the birds don't fly.</font>

22
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:20,116
<font color="#467546">And they said: because of the bells' cry.</font>

23
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:24,606
<font color="#467546">This made me sad, so all I did was walk on.</font>

24
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:32,112
<font color="#467546">And I remember now, that indeed it was the bells,</font>

25
00:01:32,113 --> 00:01:34,153
<font color="#467546">that had woken me up.</font>

26
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:37,419
<font color="#467546">The bells that had shown me this sky.</font>

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,317
<font color="#467546">But the bells are brittle, and a breeze could make them fall.</font>

28
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:47,215
<font color="#467546">And the towers are tall, so I give the wizards my thanks,</font>

29
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:50,073
<font color="#467546">and all I did was walk on.</font>

30
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,538
<font color="#467546">The bells are tolling again.</font>

31
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,579
<font color="#467546">Tolling again in the distance.</font>

32
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,886
<font color="#467546">And the bells are telling me again, that only they hold the answers.</font>

33
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:06,152
<font color="#467546">And I know, that they speak the truth.</font>

34
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#467546">So all I did was walk on.</font>

35
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:15,490
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the wizards that words reveal the world.</font>

36
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,348
<font color="#467546">For example, they taught me to see.</font>

37
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,614
<font color="#467546">See that there are mountains in the wind.</font>

38
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:24,880
<font color="#467546">See the flower forests that grow atop them.</font>

39
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:29,370
<font color="#467546">And See all that is good, and all that is bad.</font>

40
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:34,721
<font color="#467546">I found myself under large petals,</font>

41
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:37,170
<font color="#467546">and have rested here for years.</font>

42
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:41,252
<font color="#467546">I befriended the bugs, and found in them my peers.</font>

43
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:43,701
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the bugs,</font>

44
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:46,150
<font color="#467546">that wizards are made of wisps,</font>

45
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:48,599
<font color="#467546">and wisps are made of waxcaps.</font>

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,457
<font color="#467546">I was also taught by the bugs,</font>

47
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,723
<font color="#467546">that left is left, and right is right.</font>

48
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:58,397
<font color="#467546">Oh, how beautiful it is to know the world.</font>

49
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:02,071
<font color="#467546">How much more I want them to teach me!</font>

50
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:08,647
<font color="#467546">The bugs teach me everything I want to know.</font>

51
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:12,729
<font color="#467546">And they teach me everything I don't want to know.</font>

52
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,587
<font color="#467546">Hours pass, years pass, I've lost count...</font>

53
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:18,853
<font color="#467546">But there is always more beauty to show.</font>

54
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:25,021
<font color="#467546">The bugs say that they know my name.</font>

55
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:27,879
<font color="#467546">But they never teach it to me.</font>

56
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,369
<font color="#467546">And when I ask, they say that they need not teach,</font>

57
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,818
<font color="#467546">the things that I already know.</font>

58
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:39,716
<font color="#467546">And that I need not feel bad, for knowing what I am.</font>

59
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:47,108
<font color="#467546">But this time I'll sneak away, sneak away to the bells.</font>

60
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,999
<font color="#467546">For the bugs must be lying, for I know not my name.</font>

61
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:59,307
<font color="#467546">I hear the bells tolling in the tunnels that run beneath the soil.</font>

62
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:02,981
<font color="#467546">The bugs told me to never ever enter here.</font>

63
00:04:02,982 --> 00:04:07,063
<font color="#467546">But I don't believe their lies, I ignore their advice.</font>

64
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,921
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look what lies deeper inside.</font>

65
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:16,044
<font color="#467546">I walk and I walk and I walk, I cannot see the sky any more.</font>

66
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:20,126
<font color="#467546">These tunnels are warm, and indeed, no bugs swarm here.</font>

67
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:24,208
<font color="#467546">The warmth guides me deeper, it lulls me to sleep.</font>

68
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:27,066
<font color="#467546">I stop walking, I sit down, and...</font>

69
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:33,188
<font color="#467546">But the bells toll again, wake me up again,</font>

70
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,454
<font color="#467546">and remind me that I must not sleep.</font>

71
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:38,495
<font color="#467546">So I start walking again,</font>

72
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:41,761
<font color="#467546">and go where the bugs don't dare creep.</font>

73
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:47,068
<font color="#467546">I go left, I go right, but there is no bell in sight.</font>

74
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,558
<font color="#467546">But still, I can hear them. Why can't I find them?</font>

75
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,599
<font color="#467546">Did I do something wrong?</font>

76
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,640
<font color="#467546">Did I anger the bells?</font>

77
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,538
<font color="#467546">I just want to know my name, have a place to belong...</font>

78
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,212
<font color="#467546">But the bells toll me I am doing great.</font>

79
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:07,478
<font color="#467546">And that I need to keep walking on.</font>

80
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,927
<font color="#467546">But the bells, but the bugs,</font>

81
00:05:09,928 --> 00:05:12,785
<font color="#467546">they don't want me to See myself.</font>

82
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:17,274
<font color="#467546">I turn around, I'm sad,</font>

83
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,723
<font color="#467546">ignoring the bugs, was that bad?</font>

84
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,764
<font color="#467546">I wander through the tunnels.</font>

85
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:25,030
<font color="#467546">I go right, I go left, and finally,</font>

86
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,071
<font color="#467546">brighter light enters my sight.</font>

87
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:31,153
<font color="#467546">I go back to the bugs, I want to apologize,</font>

88
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,000
<font color="#467546">but they don't crawl here any more.</font>

89
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,674
<font color="#467546">I don't know how long I have been walking.</font>

90
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,940
<font color="#467546">There's only my tummy to tell the time.</font>

91
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:49,022
<font color="#467546">And a single cactus lasts me a long, long, while.</font>

92
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,063
<font color="#467546">Now, ruins lie before me.</font>

93
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,921
<font color="#467546">The bells do not like these ruins.</font>

94
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:57,595
<font color="#467546">Just like the bugs do not like the bells.</font>

95
00:05:57,596 --> 00:06:01,677
<font color="#467546">And again, I decide to ignore both, and step inside.</font>

96
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,718
<font color="#467546">Something is driving me there.</font>

97
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:08,894
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Hey, you!</font>

98
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,797
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look up, look up into the sky!</font>

99
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:13,871
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look me in the eye!</font>

100
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,945
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Splendid! Our gazes finally meet.</font>

101
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,019
<font color="#467546">Who... what...</font>

102
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,093
<font color="#467546">What are you?!</font>

103
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,167
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I am your guide, child.</font>

104
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:24,241
<font color="#467546">My... guide?</font>

105
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,974
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look at me, See me, take yourself into me.</font>

106
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,048
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I will reveal your purpose.</font>

107
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,537
<font color="#467546">No, no, no... Eye, you're scary...</font>

108
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:34,611
<font color="#467546">Please, please, let me go!</font>

109
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:40,002
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">It is not quite time to explain what it is that you see.</font>

110
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:43,320
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">You need only know that you are Me.</font>

111
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,394
<font color="#467546">And that I am You?</font>

112
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,468
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Yes, and that You are...</font>

113
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:49,542
<font color="#467546">...me. Listen, child.</font>

114
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,275
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Dedicate Yourself to Me, and all will become clear.</font>

115
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,593
<font color="#467546">Child, I shall give you one simple request.</font>

116
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:59,082
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">You must Remember who You are.</font>

117
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,156
<font color="#467546">And Whom You love.</font>

118
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:04,889
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">See... all the Angels have gone away to Fight.</font>

119
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,622
<font color="#467546">Fly, Child, fly down quickly and Join their Strife.</font>

120
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:11,940
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Lest You will gnaw at Yourself and Forget,</font>

121
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="#467546">The Meaning Of Your Life.</font>

122
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,858
<font color="#467546">The Eye, too, knows who I am...</font>

123
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,716
<font color="#467546">And the Eye, too, doesn't tell me.</font>

124
00:07:20,717 --> 00:07:24,798
<font color="#467546">But if the Eye is Me, shouldn't I know too?</font>

125
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:26,839
<font color="#467546">My head hurts...</font>

126
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,697
<font color="#467546">But I, Eye, we made a promise.</font>

127
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:33,371
<font color="#467546">If I do as it says, will I remember?</font>

128
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:38,636
<font color="#467546">But I cannot fly.</font>

129
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:43,126
<font color="#467546">And the bells toll in the distance, away from the I.</font>

130
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:45,575
<font color="#467546">Who to trust? Who to follow?</font>

131
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:47,616
<font color="#467546">Are Its words just hollow?</font>

132
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:52,106
<font color="#467546">Or is it the bells who will lead me to despair?</font>

133
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:55,780
<font color="#467546">I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!</font>

134
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,045
<font color="#467546">Well, let's go.</font>

135
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,903
<font color="#467546">I want to see more, here, first.</font>

136
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,352
<font color="#467546">I did not see everything yet.</font>

137
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,393
<font color="#467546">I want to See everything.</font>

138
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,842
<font color="#467546">No, I <i>have</i> to See everything.</font>

139
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,291
<font color="#467546">Let's go through this gate, and...</font>

140
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="#467546">are those houses in the distance?</font>

141
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#467546">Will there be friends that know my name?</font>

142
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,674
<font color="#467546">Walking through a large gate, the bells welcome me.</font>

143
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:29,123
<font color="#467546">But there is no one left,</font>

144
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,981
<font color="#467546">it's just empty houses, crumbled, nearly gone.</font>

145
00:08:31,982 --> 00:08:34,839
<font color="#467546">I just walk, and walk, and walk.</font>

146
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,921
<font color="#467546">The only things here are sand, stone, and the wind.</font>

147
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:40,962
<font color="#467546">If only there were people...</font>

148
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:47,646
<font color="#467546">My feet hurt from all of this walking...</font>

149
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:52,136
<font color="#467546">My stomach growls, but I'm oh so tired of these cacti.</font>

150
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:55,402
<font color="#467546">Why did I wake up to these islands?</font>

151
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:58,260
<font color="#467546">I just want to be someplace nice.</font>

152
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,934
<font color="#467546">For now, let's just find a place to rest.</font>

153
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:05,608
<font color="#467546">I walk into a house. No one lives here.</font>

154
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,874
<font color="#467546">But there are all kinds of things here.</font>

155
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,915
<font color="#467546">Useful things, fun things...</font>

156
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,773
<font color="#467546">But first, let's just take a nap...</font>

157
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:20,049
<font color="#467546">There is food in this house, too.</font>

158
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,539
<font color="#467546">Food so much more yummy than the cactus I've been eating.</font>

159
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,213
<font color="#467546">I really want to take it all with me,</font>

160
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:31,071
<font color="#467546">but I can't carry all of this.</font>

161
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,112
<font color="#467546">I'm sad again.</font>

162
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,153
<font color="#467546">I kick a box.</font>

163
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,194
<font color="#467546">And then, I head out.</font>

164
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:40,052
<font color="#467546">I walk around the town some more.</font>

165
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,318
<font color="#467546">In the center, there is a large tower.</font>

166
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:46,176
<font color="#467546">On top of it, a large statue.</font>

167
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:48,217
<font color="#467546">Who could that be?</font>

168
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:50,258
<font color="#467546">It looks like a king.</font>

169
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,116
<font color="#467546">Should I just go into that tower?</font>

170
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:55,157
<font color="#467546">...</font>

171
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:58,000
<font color="#467546">Yes, I Must Go into that tower.</font>

172
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,041
<font color="#467546">These plants...</font>

173
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,082
<font color="#467546">This heat...</font>

174
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,123
<font color="#467546">It feels just like before.</font>

175
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:12,613
<font color="#467546">I want to go up, but the stairs only go down.</font>

176
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,654
<font color="#467546">But that doesn't really matter.</font>

177
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,144
<font color="#467546">For some reason, I feel like what's down there is important.</font>

178
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:22,002
<font color="#467546">I just have to follow this feeling.</font>

179
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:26,492
<font color="#467546">The rooms change, this one is red, this one is white,</font>

180
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,758
<font color="#467546">this one is black, this one is yellow...</font>

181
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,616
<font color="#467546">And I keep going down. Further down.</font>

182
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:35,882
<font color="#467546">There are some puddles, but it's not water.</font>

183
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:38,740
<font color="#467546">I know I Must Not touch them.</font>

184
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,781
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>...</font>

185
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:42,822
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

186
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,863
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

187
00:10:44,864 --> 00:10:46,904
<font color="#467546">Ripples, circles, waves.</font>

188
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:49,353
<font color="#467546">But I Must Not touch them.</font>

189
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:51,802
<font color="#467546">I sit next to a puddle.</font>

190
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:54,251
<font color="#467546">And I look at my reflection.</font>

191
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,700
<font color="#467546">Do I really look like this?</font>

192
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,149
<font color="#467546">No, the puddle must be lying.</font>

193
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:04,047
<font color="#467546">I Must Not touch it, so I stand up, and keep walking.</font>

194
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,353
<font color="#467546">Suddenly, a storm.</font>

195
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:14,211
<font color="#467546">Below the tower, wind blows sand around.</font>

196
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:18,701
<font color="#467546">The sand hurts my face, but I have to go down.</font>

197
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,559
<font color="#467546">Further down, further down. Even further down.</font>

198
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,233
<font color="#467546">But now, the only way down is to jump.</font>

199
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:29,315
<font color="#467546">It's only a small distance, but it feels so far!</font>

200
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,356
<font color="#467546">I jump..</font>

201
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,397
<font color="#467546">I jump...</font>

202
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:35,438
<font color="#467546">...and land.</font>

203
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,887
<font color="#467546">But, this wind is so strong...</font>

204
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:39,928
<font color="#467546">I tumble to the edge.</font>

205
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,969
<font color="#467546">I tumble off the edge.</font>

206
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,000
<font color="#467546">Bye-bye...</font>

207
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,041
<font color="#f1b178">At last, the surface...</font>

208
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,490
<font color="#f1b178">To have finally reached up here...</font>

209
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:56,980
<font color="#f1b178">These lands are always so much more perilous than they seem.</font>

210
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,429
<font color="#f1b178">What dangers will this grove hold?</font>

211
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,470
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You did well, child.</font>

212
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,328
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Your journey is almost to an end.</font>

213
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,186
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Do not falter in its final steps.</font>

214
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:12,493
<font color="#f1b178">I only did well because I didn't run into that <i>beast</i> this time.</font>

215
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:15,759
<font color="#f1b178">It was nothing but a stroke of luck.</font>

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,025
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Child, do not concern yourself with such trivialities.</font>

217
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:21,066
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">We are up here now.</font>

218
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:25,148
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You ought to feel a sense of pride for this.</font>

219
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,189
<font color="#f1b178">You are right, my lady.</font>

220
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,638
<font color="#f1b178">Soon, I will finally reach Harmony.</font>

221
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,597
<font color="#f1b178">Venerable lady, I must confess.</font>

222
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,638
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Speak your heart, child.</font>

223
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,679
<font color="#f1b178">The stream stirs so silently...</font>

224
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,128
<font color="#f1b178">The springs bubble with such delight...</font>

225
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:51,618
<font color="#f1b178">The stars wax and wane, and the sky waves and wanders...</font>

226
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,476
<font color="#f1b178">I see such beauty in this land.</font>

227
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,517
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Does that surprise you?</font>

228
00:12:56,518 --> 00:13:00,599
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Did you not expect beauty, here in the cosmic midst?</font>

229
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,640
<font color="#f1b178">I don't know.</font>

230
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:06,722
<font color="#f1b178">It's just... the things they tell back home, they're different.</font>

231
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:08,763
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Nonetheless, they are true.</font>

232
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:11,621
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Beauty to one is horror to another.</font>

233
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:14,479
<font color="#f1b178">Then, what does that say about me?</font>

234
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,745
<font color="#f1b178">One who finds such beauty in the defiled?</font>

235
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:22,643
<font color="#f1b178">I'm aware of its evils, and the taint that stains its sky...</font>

236
00:13:22,644 --> 00:13:25,501
<font color="#f1b178">But I'm still inclined to love, somehow.</font>

237
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:27,950
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">It's all a matter of perception.</font>

238
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:31,216
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Only a right view may penetrate this illusion.</font>

239
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:33,665
<font color="#f1b178">Then do I simply lack wisdom?</font>

240
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,523
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh, dear, I'd never accuse you thereof!</font>

241
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,972
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">But indeed, you do lack wisdom.</font>

242
00:13:38,973 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

243
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:47,041
<font color="#954444">Incident: the disruptor.</font>

244
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,082
<font color="#954444">And the father said:</font>

245
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,756
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">For as long as you have known the maiden,</font>

246
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:57,246
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">He has been amongst you, and He has prayed for you;</font>

247
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:02,553
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">For as long as you have seen the stars, He has ruled them.</font>

248
00:14:02,554 --> 00:14:06,227
<font color="#954444">The father commanded his servants to embalm the girl.</font>

249
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:11,534
<font color="#954444">To baptize her in milk, and to offer her to the stars, faraway.</font>

250
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,983
<font color="#954444">And then her brother wept, crying:</font>

251
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:18,881
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I won't let the stars steal her away, she is ours forever!</font>

252
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:20,922
<font color="#954444">This disappointed the father.</font>

253
00:14:20,923 --> 00:14:22,963
<font color="#954444">He told him:</font>

254
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:27,453
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">She will return with the KING when the time is nigh.</font>

255
00:14:27,454 --> 00:14:29,902
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">When from the stars He descends.</font>

256
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:33,168
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">And when He takes our throne once more.</font>

257
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,434
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">With the KING, we walk the world eternal.</font>

258
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:42,149
<font color="#954444">The father waved his hand, watched the sky, and made disappear all the threads.</font>

259
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,823
<font color="#954444">It was day; only the brightest stars were visible.</font>

260
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:47,864
<font color="#954444">He continued:</font>

261
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,313
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">This is our kingdom, my child.</font>

262
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:54,395
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Whatever may disappear is ne'er gone, such is the sky.</font>

263
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,813
<font color="#954444">Record: the last communion.</font>

264
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,854
<font color="#954444">And the father said:</font>

265
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,895
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The Day awaits us.</font>

266
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:13,385
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The holy rite of the KING and QUEEN will soon commence.</font>

267
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:18,283
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I hereby urge you, who comprise the Kingdom under the sacred Crown,</font>

268
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,324
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Unite!</font>

269
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:22,773
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">He and His bride have settled,</font>

270
00:15:22,774 --> 00:15:26,855
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The stars have aligned to open the path to quintessence.</font>

271
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:29,713
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The Great Cathedral will house the rite,</font>

272
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,571
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Tomorrow at the time of the solstice.</font>

273
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:36,245
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Fate has it that you will all arrive tomorrow,</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">We all have been chosen.</font>

276
00:15:40,736 --> 00:15:43,593
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">We all must choose to embrace it.</font>

277

<font color="#954444">(There are no further records.)</font>

278
00:15:58,001 --> 00:16:00,041
<font color="#954444">To whom it may concern,</font>

279
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,531
<font color="#954444">We have heard some Brothers express doubt during the last Sabbath.</font>

280
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:07,389
<font color="#954444">Hearing this fills me with profound sadness.</font>

281
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,471
<font color="#954444">But, while it goes without saying, remember your Masters' teachings.</font>

282
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:17,186
<font color="#954444">Surely, you are aware of the consequences of denouncing the League in this manner.</font>

283
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:23,281
<font color="#954444">For aeons, we have upheld tradition, awaiting this moment.</font>

284
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:28,179
<font color="#954444">Thousands of our ancestors did not live to see this glorious day,</font>

285
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,445
<font color="#954444">but our patience has been rewarded at last.</font>

286
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:36,343
<font color="#954444">We shall welcome the herald of a new era in twenty-seven days.</font>

287
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:40,017
<font color="#954444">I must emphasize the importance of upholding tradition henceforth.</font>

288
00:16:40,018 --> 00:16:43,691
<font color="#954444">Only by following the past can we guarantee success.</font>

289
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:51,419
<font color="#954444">As tradition prescribes, we shall welcome all who wish to see His face.</font>

290
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,909
<font color="#954444">But to the Brothers who still harbor doubt, I say this:</font>

291
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,950
<font color="#954444">Come!</font>

292
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,808
<font color="#954444">After seeing Him with your own eyes,</font>

293
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:04,074
<font color="#954444">you shall surely be convinced he's the KING.</font>

294
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,340
<font color="#954444">The Stars have guided us to this moment.</font>

295
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,606
<font color="#954444">Hereafter, the Stars shall continue to guide us.</font>

296
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:14,688
<font color="#954444">Even if we cannot see them, we shall follow them.</font>

297
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:17,546
<font color="#954444">When the sky is obscured, consult quintessence.</font>

298
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:21,220
<font color="#954444">If ever you are in doubt, rely on tradition.</font>

299
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,723
<font color="#954444">Finally, we will be restructuring certain ranks within the League.</font>

300
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:32,213
<font color="#954444">If you believe your lineage may be affected, please visit us.</font>

301
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:37,928
<font color="#954444">To minimize danger to your lineage, we recommend leaving your disciples at your hives.</font>

302
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,969
<font color="#954444">We wish you prosperous research.</font>

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,160
<font color="#33339f">You Shall Go There Instead.</font>

412
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:45,000
<font color="#33339f">You Shall Help Our Fight There Instead.</font>

413
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,041
<font color="#467546">Phew.</font>

414
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,082
<font color="#467546">This stupid place.</font>

415
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,756
<font color="#467546">Ever since I fell, everything has been so hectic.</font>

416
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,022
<font color="#467546">That stupid Eye should've just given me wings!</font>

417
00:22:00,023 --> 00:22:03,696
<font color="#467546">The only reason I'm still alive is pure luck.</font>

418
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,370
<font color="#467546">Come on, no one could survive such a fall!</font>

419
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:13,085
<font color="#467546">But the trees caught me, I only had a few bruises, and that's that.</font>

420
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,058
<font color="#467546">I'm glad I've found this little area.</font>

421
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:23,732
<font color="#467546">The endless supply of water flowing through these gorges...</font>

422
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:27,406
<font color="#467546">The gentle breeze between the cliffs swaying the vines...</font>

423
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,447
<font color="#467546">I can actually... relax here.</font>

424
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,121
<font color="#467546">I know I shouldn't let my guard down though.</font>

425
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:36,387
<font color="#467546">With all the beasts up there and whatnot.</font>

426
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,245
<font color="#467546">Not to mention the Eye's incessant demands.</font>

427
00:22:39,246 --> 00:22:42,511
<font color="#467546">But here, I can finally take a breather...</font>

428
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:49,075
<font color="#467546">Still, it really messes with me.</font>

429
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,933
<font color="#467546">Who am I? What is this place?</font>

430
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:56,423
<font color="#467546">This sky has no sun... but it feels like it should.</font>

431
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:59,689
<font color="#467546">There is just no sense of time here.</font>

432
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,179
<font color="#467546">And having to be on my guard, always, is so taxing.</font>

433
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,077
<font color="#467546">But in these ravines, I can hardly see the sky at all.</font>

434
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:11,935
<font color="#467546">Without that eerie twilight in my view...</font>

435
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:14,384
<font color="#467546">Without the beasts that roam around...</font>

436
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:16,425
<font color="#467546">Let's take a nap...</font>

437
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,989
<font color="#467546">Why do I always forget dreams?</font>

438
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,847
<font color="#467546">I feel like this one was important.</font>

439
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:27,888
<font color="#467546">Funny how that works.</font>

440
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,929
<font color="#467546">Well then. Well now.</font>

441
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:34,000
<font color="#467546">Let's see if I can Remember anything around these parts.</font>

442

<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Venerable Lord Mettiyah, the Red Bell has rung.</font>

447
00:23:53,513 --> 00:23:58,002
<font color="#954444">That on this accursed Day, I were to teach you Death.</font>

448
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,860
<font color="#954444">Soon, Honored Brothers, shall the Sky shatter;</font>

<font color="#954444">Act 4: You shall not speak to the quintessence.</font>

503
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,890
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no emptiness,</font>

<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no loneliness,</font>

506
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:36,279
<font color="#954444">For we all shall be one and the same.</font>

507
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,545
<font color="#954444">Oh Quintessence, open our eyes to this truth.</font>

508
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:47,674
<font color="#467546">...let's break this window and get out of here.</font>

509
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:50,123
<font color="#467546">I can't stand this "quintessence" stuff.</font>

510
00:27:50,124 --> 00:27:52,164
<font color="#467546">A good three whacks, and...</font>

511
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:54,205
<font color="#467546">it shatters.</font>

512
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:58,287
<font color="#467546">The liquid doesn't even spill, it just floats in place.</font>

513
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:01,961
<font color="#467546">After climbing through, my face meets warm, subterranean air.</font>

514
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:06,043
<font color="#467546">All my senses are under constant attack in this cavern.</font>

515
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:08,084
<font color="#467546">Most jarringly, hearing.</font>

516
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:12,166
<font color="#467546">What causes these reverberations? What is all of this noise?</font>

517
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,615
<font color="#467546">Do those glowing plants cause it?</font>

518
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,473
<font color="#467546">Do they also cause this rotten smell?</font>

519
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:27,403
<font color="#467546">In the middle of this cavern is this huge pillar.</font>

520
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:30,261
<font color="#467546">Near the top, it splits into four.</font>

521
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:33,527
<font color="#467546">And then each branch, again, splits into four.</font>

522
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:35,568
<font color="#467546">Repeating, seemingly infinitely.</font>

523
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:40,875
<font color="#467546">Like that cathedral just now, it's made of that same sickly yellow rock.</font>

524
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:44,141
<font color="#467546">I'm all too familiar with it by now.</font>

525
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,182
<font color="#467546">With the same green growths...</font>

526
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,448
<font color="#467546">I'm also all too familiar with, by now.</font>

527
00:28:49,449 --> 00:28:51,897
<font color="#467546">The fissures look somewhat like writing.</font>

528
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,346
<font color="#467546">Of course, I cannot read it.</font>

529
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:58,428
<font color="#467546">I look down. The pillar goes into a lake below.</font>

530
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,102
<font color="#467546">And then, it burrows even deeper into the ground.</font>

531
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:06,592
<font color="#467546">The lake seems to contain the same stuff as everywhere else.</font>

532
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:10,674
<font color="#467546">From this high up, the crimson liquid seems to twinkle.</font>

533
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:12,715
<font color="#467546">Twinkling like the stars outside.</font>

534
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:14,756
<font color="#467546">It's almost inviting.</font>

535
00:29:14,757 --> 00:29:16,797
<font color="#467546">But I Must Not.</font>

536
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,471
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look around the rest of the cave.</font>

537
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,737
<font color="#467546">There are four bridges extending from the pillar.</font>

538
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:29,044
<font color="#467546">The center seems as good a place as any to set up camp.</font>

539
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:40,000
<font color="#467546">This place is pleasing to the senses.</font>

540
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

541
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:48,715
<font color="#954444">I begged her to never open her eyes again.</font>

542
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:53,205
<font color="#954444">Whatever she dreams of is not fit for one so innocent.</font>

543
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,246
<font color="#954444">Her spasms when asleep...</font>

544
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,287
<font color="#954444">Her demeanor when awake...</font>

545
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,961
<font color="#954444">I pray to you, let those dreams be dreams.</font>

546
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,819
<font color="#954444">No one deserves to suffer through that.</font>

547
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,534
<font color="#954444">While my daughter has yet the ability to smile, allow her to do so.</font>

548
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:12,392
<font color="#954444">I beg of you, Queen of Starlight...</font>

549
00:30:18,423 --> 00:30:23,320
<font color="#954444">When I first found her, I saw faint starlight in her eyes.</font>

550
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,586
<font color="#954444">I knew for certain she was the one.</font>

551
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:29,444
<font color="#954444">Initially, I chose her for her talent,</font>

552
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:34,751
<font color="#954444">but now I can only see someone I have to protect from themselves.</font>

553
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:38,833
<font color="#954444">I can only muster so much dedication in a lifetime.</font>

554
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:43,323
<font color="#954444">A single pupil is enough to last me until my death.</font>

555
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:49,038
<font color="#954444">I hope that she understands that, even if not by blood, she's my child.</font>

556
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,487
<font color="#954444">And I love her for it.</font>

557
00:30:57,518 --> 00:31:01,599
<font color="#954444">And now, the time has come for me to choose.</font>

558
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,640
<font color="#954444">Will I protect my daughter?</font>

559
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:06,906
<font color="#954444">Or will I stay true to my creed?</font>

560
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,947
<font color="#954444">I have always been loyal.</font>

561
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:12,213
<font color="#954444">So I beg of you, Queen of Starlight.</font>

562
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:14,254
<font color="#954444">Whatever my choice may be.</font>

563
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:17,520
<font color="#954444">Whether I become a sinner or a saint...</font>

564
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,969
<font color="#954444">Please accept my decision with grace.</font>

565
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, a lowly researcher.</font>

566
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

567
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,715
<font color="#954444">I've lied to her ever since I knew her.</font>

568
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:34,573
<font color="#954444">Yet it was all for her sake.</font>

569
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:39,471
<font color="#954444">And for as long as she didn't notice, she was indeed happy.</font>

570
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:44,369
<font color="#954444">For thirteen years, she was the happiest girl I had ever seen.</font>

571
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,818
<font color="#954444">I couldn't have asked for more.</font>

572
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,022
<font color="#954444">However,</font>

573
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:56,104
<font color="#954444">As her mental condition deteriorated, the lies failed to uphold.</font>

574
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:58,553
<font color="#954444">Lately, she acted out in rage.</font>

575
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:02,635
<font color="#954444">I had to confine her before it was too late.</font>

576
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:05,084
<font color="#954444">Rather understandably, she hates me now.</font>

577
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,125
<font color="#954444">...</font>

578
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,391
<font color="#954444">My own daughter earnestly wishes for my disappearance.</font>

579
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:15,698
<font color="#954444">If it continues like this, it won't be long before the world notices.</font>

580
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:18,964
<font color="#954444">I committed acts not worthy of your ears.</font>

581
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:25,087
<font color="#954444">The starlight in her eyes kept on growing, and so I became overwhelmed with distress.</font>

582
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,536
<font color="#954444">They had to be shut forever.</font>

583
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,577
<font color="#954444">...</font>

584
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,598
<font color="#954444">But even half-blind, she managed to escape.</font>

585
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,456
<font color="#954444">I reckon this verdict pleases you greatly.</font>

586
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,722
<font color="#954444">It IS your very own birth, after all.</font>

587
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:46,620
<font color="#954444">As for me, I don't think I can continue on any longer.</font>

588
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,069
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I love;</font>

589
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,518
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I worship;</font>

590
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,376
<font color="#954444">and in doing so, I've betrayed myself.</font>

591
00:32:54,377 --> 00:33:00,907
<font color="#954444">I'll just let her be from now on. Perhaps she will find happiness on her own.</font>

592
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,948
<font color="#954444">So.</font>

593
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,989
<font color="#954444">Queen of Starlight, my daughter.</font>

594
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,030
<font color="#954444">Like this we will part.</font>

595
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:11,112
<font color="#954444">I pray for you to one day reach an end,</font>

596
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:13,970
<font color="#954444">just as I will soon reach mine.</font>

597
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,000
<font color="#954444">Signed,</font>

598
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,041
<font color="#467546">A library, under these wetlands?</font>

599
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,082
<font color="#467546">How unexpected.</font>

600
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,531
<font color="#467546">Where to start, where to start...</font>

601
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,782
<font color="#467546">"Satvatapatvi"... "Ausrapatvi"...</font>

602
00:33:31,783 --> 00:33:36,680
<font color="#467546">What use is a great library if I don't know these languages...</font>

603
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,721
<font color="#467546">Ah, here we go!</font>

604
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:41,170
<font color="#467546">Still can't read the title, but...</font>

605
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,211
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The shepherd</font>

606
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:45,252
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The dreamer</font>

607
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:47,293
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The wise</font>

608
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:52,191
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The Shepherds of the Stars saw a new KING would be born.</font>

609
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:55,457
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Her name, SOEISE, the third KING of man.</font>

610
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,906
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">She was raised in peaceful meadows,</font>

611
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:01,988
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">and full of love for every sound and every flower;</font>

612
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:05,662
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">every insect, every leaf; every tree and every droplet;</font>

613
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:07,703
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">every star, every rock; every...</font>

614
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:10,969
<font color="#467546">...This seems to go on for a while.</font>

615
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,669
<font color="#467546">So apparently she dreamt herself all the way to the stars.</font>

616
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,159
<font color="#467546">Whatever that means. And she was the first to do so.</font>

617
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,833
<font color="#467546">Her dreams started to turn people around her mad.</font>

618
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,507
<font color="#467546">But despite all that, this book is praising her...</font>

619
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:32,548
<font color="#467546">fiscal responsibility?</font>

620
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,589
<font color="#467546">I'm grabbing another book.</font>

621
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,657
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">On the horizon, the tower grew tall.</font>

622
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:45,147
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">With its end in sight, so came our end in sight.</font>

623
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:49,229
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But born when all hope was lost, a pirate's son.</font>

624
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,495
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">His name, TEONAN, and raised by bastard thugs.</font>

625
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:56,169
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">He had but His mother's flute to take refuge.</font>

626
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,435
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But when He had even that taken away,</font>

627
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:02,293
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">when father killed mother, He killed all.</font>

628
00:35:02,294 --> 00:35:04,334
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Wrought with grief and sorrow,</font>

629
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,192
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">wrought with a desire to rewind time,</font>

630
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:09,641
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">wrought with a feeling of regret,</font>

631
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:12,090
<font color="#467546">These books really like repeating themselves.</font>

632
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:14,539
<font color="#467546">Okay, quickly going through the rest...</font>

633
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,805
<font color="#467546">He's sad, he's not sad, he's sad again,</font>

634
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:20,663
<font color="#467546">other people find out he's the king,</font>

635
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:23,521
<font color="#467546">he has to make some difficult decisions,</font>

636
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,562
<font color="#467546">and then he's sad again.</font>

637
00:35:25,563 --> 00:35:28,000
<font color="#467546">...I'm done sifting through these books.</font>

638
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,041
<font color="#954444">Quintessence.</font>

639
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:37,307
<font color="#954444">If only we could understand Its true potential.</font>

640
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:39,348
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Remember your Master's Master?</font>

641
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,389
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">She advanced our understanding greatly.</font>

642
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,063
<font color="#954444">We have certainly been able to increase Its purity.</font>

643
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:49,553
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Is your task then not the same? Follow in her footsteps.</font>

644
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:53,227
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Give us an even better view of the Starlight.</font>

645
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:56,901
<font color="#954444">You only want that for your own, selfish purposes.</font>

646
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:58,942
<font color="#954444">Am I not right?</font>

647
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:00,983
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">...</font>

648
00:36:03,218 --> 00:36:06,891
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">How have you been? It has been a while.</font>

649
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:08,932
<font color="#954444">Oh, it's only you.</font>

650
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,790
<font color="#954444">Have your rotten eyes finally failed you?</font>

651
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,648
<font color="#954444">I am busy. Do not disturb me.</font>

652
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:16,689
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Cold as ever.</font>

653
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,138
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">You ignored the last Sabbath's call.</font>

654
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:21,179
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Are you truly that busy?</font>

655
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,037
<font color="#954444">Did your Master not raise you properly?</font>

656
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:26,078
<font color="#954444">"Devote oneself to the Starlight."</font>

657
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,936
<font color="#954444">You are a disgrace to our discipline.</font>

658
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,610
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Yet <i>you</i> are the one who skipped the Sabbath.</font>

659
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,651
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">No research can justify that.</font>

660
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,692
<font color="#954444">I can taste the Starlight.</font>

661
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:40,967
<font color="#954444">This liquid is truly marvelous.</font>

662
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:43,416
<font color="#954444">I can see the stars twinkle.</font>

663
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,274
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I see your condition has worsened again.</font>

664
00:36:46,275 --> 00:36:51,581
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">You really are on the right path. It seems you drew their ire.</font>

665
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,847
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I heard they took over the other day?</font>

666
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:56,888
<font color="#954444">Ah yes...</font>

667
00:36:56,889 --> 00:37:00,970
<font color="#954444">The voices managed to break a few bones. Nothing more.</font>

668
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,644
<font color="#954444">Barely significant compared to those growths on my leg.</font>

669
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:07,093
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Have you tried watering them yet?</font>

670
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,134
<font color="#954444">Very funny...</font>

671
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:11,175
<font color="#954444">...</font>

672
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,267
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">One must not cover oneself with quintessence.</font>

673
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:18,716
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">This has long been conventional wisdom.</font>

674
00:37:18,717 --> 00:37:21,982
<font color="#954444">My mind is falling apart, I <i>need</i> this.</font>

675
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:25,248
<font color="#954444">I see glimpses of Starlight in my peripheral!</font>

676
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:28,106
<font color="#954444">Like my Master's Master! I <i>need</i> this!</font>

677
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:30,964
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">It is an inevitability of our research.</font>

678
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:35,862
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But it is always so sad to see a dear friend go.</font>

679
00:37:35,863 --> 00:37:39,128
<font color="#954444">I will not let those angels stop me.</font>

681
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,118
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Truly unfortunate.</font>

682
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,567
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Only a pile of mush remains.</font>

691
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:25,357
<font color="#467546">So apparently, the world ends.</font>

692
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:27,398
<font color="#467546">Quite quickly, in fact.</font>

693
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:30,256
<font color="#467546">Here I am, sitting on the ledge.</font>

694
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,297

695
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:36,379

696
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,237
<font color="#467546">And the stars... They're so very pretty.</font>

697
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:42,503
<font color="#467546">How they pulse, oscillate, fade in, fade out.</font>

698
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:45,361
<font color="#467546">To think that they could read these...</font>

699
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:48,627
<font color="#467546">Wouldn't it be nice if I could, too?</font>

700
00:38:51,903 --> 00:38:53,943
<font color="#467546">What was it like, before?</font>

701
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:57,209
<font color="#467546">Before I woke up in those floating towers?</font>

702
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,699
<font color="#467546">I know there probably isn't a "before", but I can dream.</font>

706
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,628

707
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:22,118
<font color="#467546">Things are starting to make sense, in their own, twisted way.</font>

708
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,159
<font color="#467546">But I still don't understand.</font>

709
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,608
<font color="#467546">Why did I wake up here?</font>

710
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:29,057
<font color="#467546">Who am I? Why am I?</font>

711
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:35,190
<font color="#467546">This one idiom suddenly comes to mind...</font>

712
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:37,231
<font color="#467546">The "call of the void"?</font>

713
00:39:37,232 --> 00:39:40,905
<font color="#467546">I've never heard it before... but it feels right.</font>

714
00:39:40,906 --> 00:39:44,171
<font color="#467546">There is no "bottom" below my feet here.</font>

715
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,212
<font color="#467546">Everything just becomes hazy.</font>

716
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,253
<font color="#467546">Everything just loses definition.</font>

717
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:52,335
<font color="#467546">This morbid curiosity of wanting to know what's down there.</font>

718
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:54,376
<font color="#467546">Or what <i>isn't</i> down there.</font>

719
00:39:57,652 --> 00:40:02,141
<font color="#467546">From the empty void, a lukewarm breeze flows through my hair.</font>

720
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:04,182
<font color="#467546">Where does it come from?</font>

721
00:40:04,183 --> 00:40:06,223
<font color="#467546">...</font>

722
00:40:06,224 --> 00:40:11,121
<font color="#467546">Heh, I should've learnt to stop questioning things like that long ago.</font>

723
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:16,428
<font color="#467546">The bugs tried their best, but there's so much they did not teach.</font>

724
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:21,735
<font color="#467546">Every time I think I figure something out, this place surprises me again.</font>

725
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:27,042
<font color="#467546">But this place, the entire thing, feels a little like a "home", now.</font>

726
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,083
<font color="#467546">Somehow.</font>

727
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:33,573
<font color="#467546">For all of its faults, it really is a beautiful home.</font>

728
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,889
<font color="#467546">Enough monologuing.</font>

729
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,971
<font color="#467546">No one here to listen to me babble on anyways.</font>

730
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#467546">Let's get moving again.</font>

731
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,490
<font color="#467546">Yuck, the quintessence in these caves is so much more potent.</font>

739
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,036
<font color="#467546">They seemed to deify it.</font>

740
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:21,485
<font color="#467546">From what I could understand, anyway.</font>

741

00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:18,186
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">So the skin of marble, and the cracks upon her face...</font>

815
00:45:18,187 --> 00:45:22,676
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">So the eyes of ink, and the blood upon her wings...</font>

816
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:24,717
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">It was meant to be?</font>

817
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:26,758
<font color="#428686">But of course!</font>

818
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:29,616
<font color="#428686">All that ceases is destined to return.</font>

819
00:45:29,617 --> 00:45:31,657
<font color="#428686">Witness, dear child of mine:</font>

820
00:45:31,658 --> 00:45:33,698
<font color="#428686">Rebirth. The Law of Heaven!</font>

821
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,739
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I see...</font>

822
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,188
<font color="#428686">Do not fret, do not fret.</font>

823
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:40,229
<font color="#428686">'Tis what makes us immortal.</font>

824
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,286
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I understand.</font>

825
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,327
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But...</font>

826
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:52,368
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">...</font>

827
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:55,221
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But my daughter, is she still there?</font>

828
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:58,079
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">What did you do to my daughter?!</font>

829
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,120
<font color="#428686">Breathe in, child.</font>

830
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:02,569
<font color="#428686">See there, her heart of marble.</font>

831
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:04,610
<font color="#428686">She still loves you, child.</font>

832
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,059
<font color="#428686">And with love, she shall conquer.</font>

833
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,508
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But is she not the Harbinger?</font>

834
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:12,366
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Whose sword sheds the blood of nations,</font>

835
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,224
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">whose voice judges the fate of kings...</font>

836
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:17,265
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Is she not ages-old?</font>

837
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:19,306
<font color="#428686">Indeed, she is!</font>

838
00:46:19,307 --> 00:46:22,980
<font color="#428686">But you yourself, before your birth, were you naught?</font>

839
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,021
<font color="#428686">Are you not ages-old, too?</font>

840
00:46:25,022 --> 00:46:27,062
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I might be...</font>

841
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:29,103
<font color="#428686">And have you not killed?</font>

842
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:31,144
<font color="#428686">Have you not judged?</font>

843
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:40,502
<font color="#428686">Do away with your illusions, child.</font>

844
00:46:40,503 --> 00:46:44,584
<font color="#428686">To love her rightly is to love all of her.</font>

845
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:47,442
<font color="#428686">Whether girl or harbinger, innocent or cruel.</font>

846
00:46:47,443 --> 00:46:49,483
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I understand, venerable lady.</font>

847
00:46:49,484 --> 00:46:51,932
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But I still need some time.</font>

848
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:53,973
<font color="#428686">Do as you will.</font>

849
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:56,831
<font color="#428686">Harmony is within you, stand and gaze!</font>

850
00:46:56,832 --> 00:47:00,097
<font color="#428686">Gaze at what the Heavens have gifted you!</font>

851
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,041
<font color="#467546">Screw these caves.</font>

852
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,899
<font color="#467546">They are large, hot, labyrinthine, and worse,</font>

853
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,348
<font color="#467546"><i>much</i> more dangerous than those wetlands.</font>

854
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:22,022
<font color="#467546">I've only Remembered what, like eight Memories so far?</font>

855
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:25,696
<font color="#467546">If only this place was a little more reasonable...</font>

856
00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:28,554
<font color="#467546">I would've long completed this stupid task.</font>

857
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:33,861
<font color="#467546">But I've agreed to it, so for the Eye's sake, I Must Continue.</font>

858
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:36,719
<font color="#467546">Not much else to do here, anyway.</font>

859
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,760
<font color="#467546">...</font>

860
00:47:38,761 --> 00:47:43,658
<font color="#467546">But I feel like I've found everything these caves have to offer.</font>

861
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:47,740
<font color="#467546">There's that river, that cathedral, that <i>thing</i> in the center,</font>

862
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:51,822
<font color="#467546">that fungus place, that palace that gives me the creeps...</font>

863
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:53,863
<font color="#467546">None lead me further.</font>

864
00:47:53,864 --> 00:47:58,353
<font color="#467546">Surely I don't have to dig my way down, do I?</font>

865
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:05,366
<font color="#467546">Finally...</font>

866
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:08,224
<font color="#467546">I've been wandering these caves for ages,</font>

867
00:48:08,225 --> 00:48:10,673
<font color="#467546">turning every stone like a madman...</font>

868
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:12,714
<font color="#467546">Why here, of all places!</font>

869
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:15,163
<font color="#467546">Ah, finally something to do again!</font>

870
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:22,993
<font color="#467546">Who put these traps in these ruins!</font>

871
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:26,259
<font color="#467546">It makes no sense how they still work!</font>

872
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,974
<font color="#467546">This place looks like it's designed to do one thing, and one thing only:</font>

873
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,015
<font color="#467546">Kill. Specifically, me.</font>

874
00:48:34,016 --> 00:48:37,689
<font color="#467546">Moreso than any other place I've been, at least.</font>

875
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,547
<font color="#467546">Usually the wildlife is the dangerous part...</font>

876
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:45,445
<font color="#467546">But here, the floor collapses, I get shot at out of nowhere...</font>

877
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:48,711
<font color="#467546">I've even had the ceiling collapse on me!</font>

878
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:51,569
<font color="#467546">This infernal heat is also something else.</font>

879
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:55,243
<font color="#467546">I really can't focus on my surroundings like this.</font>

880
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:58,509
<font color="#467546">To think I found those caves too dangerous...</font>

881
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,367
<font color="#467546">They pale in comparison to this place.</font>

882
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:06,265
<font color="#467546">I honestly want to take a break, go back to those wetlands...</font>

883
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,714
<font color="#467546">and just <i>relax</i> for a moment.</font>

884
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:12,796
<font color="#467546">Or perhaps, those gardens. Those are a bit closer by.</font>

885
00:49:12,797 --> 00:49:16,878
<font color="#467546">(But then I'd need to go through that palace again...)</font>

886
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:25,524
<font color="#467546">I do see the beauty of places like this.</font>

887
00:49:25,525 --> 00:49:27,565
<font color="#467546">Really, I do.</font>

888
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:31,239
<font color="#467546">It's just, harder, when they're trying to kill me!</font>

889
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,505
<font color="#467546">It seems like I've reached the end though.</font>

890
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,546
<font color="#467546">This door is huge, and...</font>

891
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:38,587
<font color="#467546">I Sense Someone Behind It.</font>

892
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:40,628
<font color="#467546">Another, normal, living being.</font>

893
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,669
<font color="#467546">Sigh.</font>

894
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,935
<font color="#467546">Of course the halfway point is being guarded.</font>

895
00:49:45,936 --> 00:49:47,976
<font color="#467546">Why wouldn't it be?</font>

896
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:50,000
<font color="#467546">I'm ready. Let's go.</font>

897
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,449
<font color="#eefc9a">What to name our son, milord?</font>

898
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,490
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...</font>

899
00:49:58,491 --> 00:50:01,348
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">He shall be Lord of the Earth,</font>

900
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,430
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">the lion whose claws shall quench the fires of Hell,</font>

901
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:07,879
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">who bestows upon man their wings.</font>

902
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,328
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">So His name shall be ARIEL,</font>

903
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:14,002
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">and the Old Earth shall run through His veins.</font>

904
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:16,043
<font color="#eefc9a">"Ariel"... Beautiful, milord.</font>

905
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:18,901
<font color="#eefc9a">Look at his eyes, aren’t they magical?</font>

906
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:20,942
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ice-white, like yours once were.</font>

907
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:24,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">See? All is as told; He is our KING.</font>

908
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:28,290
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">And you have always been destined to bear Him.</font>

909
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,331
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

910
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:33,597
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The pilgrims are here. The gates shall open.</font>

911
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:37,679
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Sing Him a song, and wear your mask with grace.</font>

912
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,608
<font color="#eefc9a">Little Ariel, how softly your heart beats...</font>

913
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:46,466
<font color="#eefc9a">Your blank little heart, free from desire.</font>

914
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,507
<font color="#eefc9a">May it remain pure forevermore.</font>

915
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:50,548
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

916
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:55,446
<font color="#eefc9a">I pray you will grow up a better man than your father.</font>

917
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:00,558
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Greetings, Auzandil. How is Ariel?</font>

918
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,865
<font color="#eefc9a">Come in, dear! Oh how I’ve missed you. How was your time at-</font>

919
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,906
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Answer me. How is Ariel?</font>

920
00:51:07,907 --> 00:51:11,988
<font color="#eefc9a">He walks and he talks, he reads and he writes...</font>

921
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,437
<font color="#eefc9a">He even reflects on his meditations.</font>

922
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,703
<font color="#eefc9a">He is growing into a wise prince, milord.</font>

923
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:20,969
<font color="#eefc9a">And yet, the curse has not taken him.</font>

924
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,235
<font color="#eefc9a">He is perfect, milord. And so, so lovely.</font>

925
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,276
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Good. But remember:</font>

926
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:28,725
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Do not get attached to Him.</font>

927
00:51:28,726 --> 00:51:32,807
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">His might far exceeds our own. <b>Do not forget this</b>.</font>

928
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,665
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Soon, the young Messiah will join me.</font>

929
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,706
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Prepare Him for His travels.</font>

930
00:51:37,707 --> 00:51:40,972
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Teach Him the words. Do not disappoint me.</font>

931
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,000
<font color="#eefc9a">Understood, milord.</font>

932
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel, attend to your studies at once!</font>

933
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:51,113
<font color="#f1b178">No. This is where Mother sat.</font>

934
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:54,114
<font color="#f1b178">She was dreaming, father. And then, you...</font>

935
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,257
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">How oft must I reiterate!</font>

936
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:58,400
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Enough of this attachment!</font>

937
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:01,401
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The King must ascend above His Kingdom.</font>

938
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:06,544
<font color="#f1b178">"...Ascend above The Kingdom, to cradle it from the clouds", said Teonan.</font>

939
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:09,973
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Silence! Do not talk back at me, Ariel.</font>

940
00:52:09,974 --> 00:52:12,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Go and reflect on your actions.</font>

941
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,601
<font color="#f1b178">Go and reflect on how you slit Mother's throat, father.</font>

942
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,849
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...Ariel. I have the League in my reins.</font>

943
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,285
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Without the League, you are <b>nothing</b>.</font>

944
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,533
<font color="#f1b178">Without your League, I am still the King.</font>

945
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,187
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel. Know that half the world wishes you dead.</font>

946
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,623
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The League is your sole refuge.</font>

947
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:36,495
<font color="#f1b178">If half the world wishes me dead, then let them kill me.</font>

948
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:39,743
<font color="#f1b178">I’ll become a martyr for the other half.</font>

949
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:45,021
<font color="#f1b178">The whole world shall sing my name toward the pike impaling your head.</font>

950
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:47,051
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You wasteful, manic imbecile.</font>

951
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,705
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Thousands of lives lie wasted within your livid mind.</font>

952
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:52,735
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You remember nothing, don’t you?!</font>

953
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,765
<font color="#f1b178">I do, father.</font>

954
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,201
<font color="#f1b178">"You shall perish of hunger, father."</font>

955
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:59,231
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Shut your mouth!</font>

956
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:02,479
<font color="#f1b178">"And your blood shall stain the desert storms."</font>

957
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,915
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">I’ll make you a martyr, alright!</font>

958
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,975
<font color="#f1b178">"You were a beast, and you shall die as such."</font>

959
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,000
<font color="#f1b178">Farewell, father.</font>

960
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:17,674
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">So, in the end it was all a lie.</font>

961
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:22,572
<font color="#f1b178">That's right. But it wasn't all for naught; 'cause I met you.</font>

962
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:25,430
<font color="#f1b178">And with that, all the world's beauty.</font>

963
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:29,104
<font color="#f1b178">Do you hear the seagulls hovering over your head?</font>

964
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,370
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">And the sun rays shearing over the sea...</font>

965
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,636
<font color="#f1b178">And the fresh air breezing through your lungs...</font>

966
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:40,534
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">I'm proud to share these feelings with you, false King of Man.</font>

967
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:42,575
<font color="#f1b178">Shut your mouth, piss-poor horse-herder.</font>

968
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:44,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Thank you.</font>

969
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,657
<font color="#f1b178">No problem, brother.</font>

970
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:49,691
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Look, Ariel, the sky has opened.</font>

971
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,732
<font color="#f1b178">Unbelievable... Shall we stargaze?</font>

972
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:56,222
<font color="#f1b178">And read each other's fates, as did the Kings of old.</font>

973
00:53:56,223 --> 00:54:00,304
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Intimate, isn't it? Surely, we too shall fall in love.</font>

974
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,930
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">You know, Ariel.</font>

975
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:06,604
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">In another life, this could've been my journey's end.</font>

976
00:54:06,605 --> 00:54:09,462
<font color="#f1b178">It can still be. Join me, Sal.</font>

977
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,911
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Where will you travel next, then?</font>

978
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:16,401
<font color="#f1b178">The Holy Land, brother. Did the stars not make that clear?</font>

979
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,850
<font color="#f1b178">Join me; let's find peace together.</font>

980
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:21,299
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Hmm... What do the stars foretell?</font>

981
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,565
<font color="#f1b178">Damned be the stars. Choose your own path!</font>

982
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:29,055
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">But the stars are my path, Ariel, and you know that.</font>

983
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,681
<font color="#f1b178">Burning ambition and maniacal confusion.</font>

984
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,539
<font color="#f1b178">That's what I saw in your path.</font>

985
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,846
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sounds quite exciting to me. If that's my fate, then so be it.</font>

986
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:42,295
<font color="#f1b178">What a stubborn man you are.</font>

987
00:54:42,296 --> 00:54:44,336
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Don’t worry, Ariel.</font>

988
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:48,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Our fates may diverge, but this night is ours!</font>

989
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,878
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, by the stars, I should have known!</font>

990
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,010
<font color="#f1b178">By the charm in his forever-smile,</font>

991
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,497
<font color="#f1b178">by the splendor in his stilted speech,</font>

992
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,984
<font color="#f1b178">by the shimmer in his somber eyes...</font>

993
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:04,761
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known!</font>

994
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:08,314
<font color="#f1b178">I loved him, I loved him, I loved him dearly.</font>

995
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:11,512
<font color="#f1b178">That man with a mind serene as the stars,</font>

996
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:15,776
<font color="#f1b178">that man who dreamed to wed himself to life and its beauty.</font>

997
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:18,971
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, then, that he was still...</font>

998
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:22,645
<font color="#f1b178">that bloodied cripple, who walked the meadows in mania.</font>

999
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,094
<font color="#f1b178">Cradling his kingdom from the clouds,</font>

1000
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:27,952
<font color="#f1b178">to drown it in its own blood;</font>

1001
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,401
<font color="#f1b178">he is rotten to the bone.</font>

1002
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,483
<font color="#f1b178">I hate you, Sal. I hate every one of you.</font>

1003
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:41,204
<font color="#f1b178">Mother, I am hating, forgive me.</font>

1004
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,062
<font color="#f1b178">My son, I am hating, hear me.</font>

1005
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:46,920
<font color="#f1b178">My daughter, I am hating, cleanse me.</font>

1006
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,186
<font color="#f1b178">My wife, I am hating, stand with me.</font>

1007
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:52,227
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

1008
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:55,493
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I am hating, come to me.</font>

1009
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:59,570
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I shall not hate, for I shall fight.</font>

1010
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,611
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, hear my prayer!</font>

1011
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:06,612
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You've finally made it, prince Ariel.</font>

1012
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,653
<font color="#f1b178">...greetings, venerable lady.</font>

1013
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,919
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh poor thing, such stillness in your voice.</font>

1014
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,001
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Have you seen your own eyes? How dejected, how determined.</font>

1015
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:18,859
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">The journey. What did it cost you?</font>

1016
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,900
<font color="#f1b178">Everything, venerable lady.</font>

1017
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:22,941
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Excellent. I know enough.</font>

1018
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:25,390
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You, Ariel, will be my apprentice.</font>

1019
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:27,431
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Now bow.</font>

1020
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,472
<font color="#f1b178">Thank you, venerable lady.</font>

1021
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,513
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Welcome to our crusade, Ariel.</font>

1022
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:36,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Death to the King. Death to his Kingdom. Hail the Azachon.</font>

1023
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:43,814
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1024
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:47,488
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

1025
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:51,162
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1026
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,020
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Father, we hear footsteps in the distance.</font>

1027
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,061
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He is here.</font>

1028
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,735
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1029
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:03,409
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

1030
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,090
<font color="#f1b178">My mind is a maelstrom and I See all.</font>

1031
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,948
<font color="#f1b178">In this moment, I pervade every sensation.</font>

1032
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:15,030
<font color="#f1b178">Be it the sensation of my body directing its dance,</font>

1033
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,704
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my arm bending and bleeding,</font>

1034
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,378
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my fingers weaving their song,</font>

1035
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:26,460
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of scorn for the beast before me.</font>

1036
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,726
<font color="#f1b178">At the apex of obsession, all is one.</font>

1037
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,767
<font color="#f1b178">This beast shall be slain.</font>

1038
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:36,040
<font color="#f1b178">Floors have shattered, the beast is pushing through.</font>

1039
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:40,122
<font color="#f1b178">There is not a single emotion upon his disgusting face.</font>

1040
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,571
<font color="#f1b178">Does there not linger Soeise's compassion,</font>

1041
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:45,020
<font color="#f1b178">or Roeroan's rage or Teonan's guilt,</font>

1042
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:48,286
<font color="#f1b178">or the beautiful reverence once harbored by Sal?</font>

1043
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,327
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">You are hating, father.</font>

1044
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,368
<font color="#f1b178">Speak, devil, speak!</font>

1045
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,409
<font color="#f1b178">I beg of you, speak!</font>

1046
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,865
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop, father, you are hurting, hurting!</font>

1047
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,906
<font color="#f1b178"><b>Speak to me, brother!</b></font>

1048
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,947
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop right now!</font>

1049
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,805
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Retreat at once! Do it for us!</font>

1050
00:58:04,806 --> 00:58:06,846
<font color="#f1b178">I must... not...</font>

1051
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,887
<font color="#f1b178">Merely...</font>

1052
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,928
<font color="#f1b178">Oh Azachon... almighty...</font>

1053
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:12,969
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

1054
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,000
<font color="#f1b178">Ah... I have... failed.</font>

1055
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,858
<font color="#467546">What was that guy going on about?</font>

1056
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:23,899
<font color="#467546">Me, a "beast"? A "devil"?</font>

1057
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,757
<font color="#467546">My memories contain nothing warranting such words.</font>

1058
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:30,023
<font color="#467546">...and these Memories aren't mine to begin with.</font>

1059
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:32,064
<font color="#467546">...Right?</font>

1060
00:58:32,065 --> 00:58:34,922
<font color="#467546">He also muttered something about the Eye.</font>

1061
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:38,188
<font color="#467546">I'm simply doing what It requests of me.</font>

1062
00:58:38,189 --> 00:58:41,454
<font color="#467546">Doesn't that mean we're on the same side?</font>

1063
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:43,903
<font color="#467546">Then why attack me so fiercely?</font>

1064
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:49,345
<font color="#467546">But that fight really brought us down deep, huh.</font>

1065
00:58:49,346 --> 00:58:53,427
<font color="#467546">I can't even make out the ceiling at this point.</font>

1066
00:58:53,428 --> 00:58:58,734
<font color="#467546">This place was already ruined beyond belief, but we didn't really help matters.</font>

1067
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,816
<font color="#467546">I hope I can still find something under the rubble.</font>

1068
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:08,531
<font color="#467546">Though, this fight was more informative than any of the Eye's Memories so far.</font>

1069
00:59:08,532 --> 00:59:11,797
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I should ask the Eye about this.</font>

1070
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,655
<font color="#467546">...On second thought, perhaps I should not.</font>

1071
00:59:16,424 --> 00:59:20,505
<font color="#467546">I thought it was because of all the fighting, but...</font>

1072
00:59:20,506 --> 00:59:22,546
<font color="#467546">It's <i>hot</i> down here.</font>

1073
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:26,220
<font color="#467546">So much hotter than the caverns and ruins above.</font>

1074
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:29,078
<font color="#467546">Yet, somehow, I don't really <i>feel</i> it.</font>

1075
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:32,752
<font color="#467546">I feel like I'm changing the deeper I'm going.</font>

1076
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:36,018
<font color="#467546">I don't need to sleep any more, either.</font>

1077
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:38,059
<font color="#467546">My appetite's also disappeared...</font>

1078
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:41,325
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">But I guess that's all a good thing.</font>

1079
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:46,223
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sleep and meals in a place like this are only a bother.</font>

1080
00:59:47,992 --> 00:59:50,032
