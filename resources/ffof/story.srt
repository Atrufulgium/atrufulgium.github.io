1
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:12,920
<font color="#467546">I was dreaming just now,</font>

2
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:16,610
<font color="#467546">and I dreamt of an eye.</font>

3
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:20,300
<font color="#467546">Now, I forget, I wonder...</font>

4
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#467546">Who am I?</font>

5
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:30,000
<font color="#467546">Mom, Dad, where are you?!</font>

6
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,034
<font color="#467546">That dream...</font>

7
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:37,749
<font color="#467546">I was up high in the sky.</font>

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,403
<font color="#467546">Falling, into a red sea.</font>

9
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:43,057
<font color="#467546">And then, that eye...</font>

10
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,711
<font color="#467546">...</font>

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,895
<font color="#467546">I'm up high in the sky.</font>

12
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,079
<font color="#467546">But this time, I'm not falling.</font>

13
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,735
<font color="#467546">Well, let's go.</font>

14
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:00,919
<font color="#467546">Towers are rising from the clouds.</font>

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,103
<font color="#467546">Wizards play with strings and wings.</font>

16
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:08,348
<font color="#467546">They watch the skies, where no bird flies.</font>

17
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:13,655
<font color="#467546">I once asked the wizards why the birds don't fly.</font>

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,900
<font color="#467546">And they said: because of the bells' cry.</font>

19
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:28,862
<font color="#467546">And I remember now, that indeed it was the bells, that had woken me up.</font>

20
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:33,107
<font color="#467546">The bells that had shown me this sky.</font>

21
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:39,475
<font color="#467546">But the bells are brittle, and a breeze could make them fall.</font>

22
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:45,843
<font color="#467546">And the towers are tall, so I give the wizards my thanks,</font>

23
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:49,558
<font color="#467546">and all I did was continue on.</font>

24
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,214
<font color="#467546">The bells are tolling again.</font>

25
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,868
<font color="#467546">Tolling again in the distance.</font>

26
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:04,766
<font color="#467546">And the bells are telling me again, that only they hold the answers.</font>

27
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#467546">And I know, that they speak the truth.</font>

28
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:18,389
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the wizards that words reveal the world.</font>

29
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,818
<font color="#467546">For example, they taught me to See.</font>

30
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,737
<font color="#467546">See that there are mountains in the wind.</font>

31
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:29,656
<font color="#467546">See the flower forests that grow atop them.</font>

32
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:35,534
<font color="#467546">And See all that is good, and See all that is bad.</font>

33
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:40,465
<font color="#467546">I found myself under large petals,</font>

34
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,404
<font color="#467546">and have rested here for years.</font>

35
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:48,302
<font color="#467546">I befriended the bugs, and found in them my peers.</font>

36
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:51,241
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the bugs,</font>

37
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:54,180
<font color="#467546">that wizards are made of wisps,</font>

38
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,119
<font color="#467546">and wisps are made of spores.</font>

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,548
<font color="#467546">I was also taught by the bugs,</font>

40
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,467
<font color="#467546">that left is left, and right is right.</font>

41
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:08,876
<font color="#467546">Oh, how beautiful it is to know the world.</font>

42
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:15,277
<font color="#467546">The bugs teach me everything I need to know.</font>

43
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,706
<font color="#467546">Hours pass, years pass, I've lost count...</font>

44
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:23,115
<font color="#467546">But the bugs say that they know my name.</font>

45
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:26,544
<font color="#467546">Yet they never teach it to me.</font>

46
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:31,932
<font color="#467546">And when I ask, they say that they need not teach,</font>

47
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,871
<font color="#467546">the things that I already know.</font>

48
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:40,749
<font color="#467546">And that I need not feel bad, for knowing what I am.</font>

49
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:48,129
<font color="#467546">But this time I'll sneak away, sneak away to the bells.</font>

50
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,999
<font color="#467546">For the bugs must be lying, for I know not my name.</font>

51
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,593
<font color="#467546">I hear the bells tolling in these tunnels.</font>

52
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:03,634
<font color="#467546">The bugs told me to never ever enter here.</font>

53
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:08,124
<font color="#467546">But I don't believe their lies, I ignore their advice.</font>

54
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,267
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look what lies deeper inside.</font>

55
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:18,002
<font color="#467546">I walk and I walk and I walk, I cannot see the sky any more.</font>

56
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:20,247
<font color="#467546">These tunnels are warm.</font>

57
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:24,737
<font color="#467546">The warmth guides me deeper, it lulls me to sleep.</font>

58
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,880
<font color="#467546">I stop walking, I sit down, and...</font>

59
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:34,553
<font color="#467546">But the bells toll again, wake me up again,</font>

60
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:38,145
<font color="#467546">and remind me that I must not sleep.</font>

61
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:43,982
<font color="#467546">I go left, I go right, but there is no bell in sight.</font>

62
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:49,370
<font color="#467546">But still, I can hear the bells. Why can't I find them?</font>

63
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,615
<font color="#467546">Did I do something wrong?</font>

64
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:53,860
<font color="#467546">Did I anger the bells?</font>

65
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:59,248
<font color="#467546">I just want to know my name, have a place to belong...</font>

66
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:03,289
<font color="#467546">But the bells told me I am doing great.</font>

67
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,881
<font color="#467546">And that I need to keep walking on.</font>

68
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:09,575
<font color="#467546">But the bells, but the bugs,</font>

69
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,718
<font color="#467546">they don't want me to See myself.</font>

70
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,595
<font color="#467546">I turn around, I'm sad,</font>

71
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:20,289
<font color="#467546">ignoring the bugs, was that bad?</font>

72
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,534
<font color="#467546">I wander through the tunnels.</font>

73
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:26,126
<font color="#467546">I go right, I go left, and finally,</font>

74
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,371
<font color="#467546">brighter light enters my sight.</font>

75
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:32,861
<font color="#467546">I go back to the bugs, I want to apologize,</font>

76
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:36,000
<font color="#467546">but they don't crawl here any more.</font>

77
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:43,675
<font color="#467546">I don't know how long I have been walking.</font>

78
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,941
<font color="#467546">There's only my tummy to tell the time.</font>

79
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:51,023
<font color="#467546">And a single cactus lasts me a long, long, while.</font>

80
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:53,064
<font color="#467546">Now, ruins lie before me.</font>

81
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:55,922
<font color="#467546">The bells do not like these ruins.</font>

82
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,596
<font color="#467546">Just like the bugs do not like the bells.</font>

83
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:03,678
<font color="#467546">And again, I decide to ignore both, and step inside.</font>

84
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:08,894
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Hey, you!</font>

85
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,797
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look up, look up into the sky!</font>

86
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:13,871
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look me in the eye!</font>

87
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,945
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Splendid! Our gazes finally meet.</font>

88
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,019
<font color="#467546">Who... what...</font>

89
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,093
<font color="#467546">What are you?!</font>

90
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:22,167
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I am your guide, child.</font>

91
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:24,241
<font color="#467546">My... guide?</font>

92
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:27,974
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look at me, See me, take yourself into me.</font>

93
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:30,048
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I will reveal your purpose.</font>

94
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,537
<font color="#467546">No, no, no... Eye, you're scary...</font>

95
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:34,611
<font color="#467546">Please, please, let me go!</font>

96
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:40,002
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">It is not quite time to explain what it is that you see.</font>

97
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:43,320
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">You need only know that you are Me.</font>

98
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,394
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">And that I am You?</font>

99
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,883
<font color="#33339f">Yes, and that You are me.</font>

100
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,957
<font color="#33339f">Listen, child.</font>

101
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,690
<font color="#33339f">Dedicate Yourself to Me, and all will become clear.</font>

102
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,593
<font color="#33339f">I shall give you one simple request.</font>

103
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:59,082
<font color="#33339f">You must Remember who You are.</font>

104
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,156
<font color="#33339f">And Whom You love.</font>

105
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:04,889
<font color="#33339f">See... all the Angels have gone away to Fight.</font>

106
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,622
<font color="#33339f">Fly, Child, fly down quickly and Join their Strife.</font>

107
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:11,940
<font color="#33339f">Lest You will gnaw at Yourself and Forget,</font>

108
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="#33339f">The Meaning Of Your Life.</font>

109
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:20,267
<font color="#467546">So this Eye, too, knows who I am...</font>

110
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:23,125
<font color="#467546">And the Eye, too, doesn't tell me.</font>

111
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:27,207
<font color="#467546">But if the Eye is Me, shouldn't I know too?</font>

112
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,248
<font color="#467546">My head hurts...</font>

113
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,106
<font color="#467546">But I, Eye, we made a promise.</font>

114
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:35,780
<font color="#467546">If I do as it says, will I remember?</font>

115
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,453
<font color="#467546">But I cannot fly.</font>

116
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:45,351
<font color="#467546">And the bells toll in the distance, away from the Eye, I.</font>

117
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,800
<font color="#467546">Who to trust? Who to follow?</font>

118
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,698
<font color="#467546">Are Its words a trick? Is it the bells who are wrong?</font>

119
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:56,372
<font color="#467546">I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!</font>

120
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,045
<font color="#467546">Well, let's go.</font>

121
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,903
<font color="#467546">I want to see more, here, first.</font>

122
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,352
<font color="#467546">I did not see everything yet.</font>

123
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,393
<font color="#467546">I want to See everything.</font>

124
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,842
<font color="#467546">No, I <i>have</i> to See everything.</font>

125
00:08:10,843 --> 00:08:13,291
<font color="#467546">Let's go through this gate, and...</font>

126
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,740
<font color="#467546">are those houses in the distance?</font>

127
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#467546">Will there be friends that know my name?</font>

128
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:28,675
<font color="#467546">Walking through a large gate, the bells welcome me.</font>

129
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,124
<font color="#467546">But there is no one left,</font>

130
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,982
<font color="#467546">it's just empty houses, crumbled, nearly gone.</font>

131
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,840
<font color="#467546">I just walk, and walk, and walk.</font>

132
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:39,289
<font color="#467546">If only there was anyone here...</font>

133
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:46,401
<font color="#467546">My feet hurt from all of this walking...</font>

134
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:50,075
<font color="#467546">My stomach growls, but I'm tired of these cacti.</font>

135
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,341
<font color="#467546">Why did I wake up to these islands?</font>

136
00:08:53,342 --> 00:08:56,199
<font color="#467546">I just want to be someplace nice.</font>

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,873
<font color="#467546">For now, let's just find a place to rest.</font>

138
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,547
<font color="#467546">I walk into a house. No one lives here.</font>

139
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:06,813
<font color="#467546">But there are all kinds of things here.</font>

140
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,854
<font color="#467546">Useful things, fun things...</font>

141
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:11,712
<font color="#467546">But first, let's just take a nap...</font>

142
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,599
<font color="#467546">The bells toll again.</font>

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,048
<font color="#467546">There is food in this house.</font>

144
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:24,538
<font color="#467546">Food so much more yummy than the cactus I've been eating.</font>

145
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,212
<font color="#467546">I want to take all of it with me,</font>

146
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,070
<font color="#467546">but I can't carry all of this.</font>

147
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,111
<font color="#467546">I'm sad again.</font>

148
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,152
<font color="#467546">I kick a box.</font>

149
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:37,193
<font color="#467546">And then, I head out.</font>

150
00:09:37,194 --> 00:09:40,051
<font color="#467546">I walk around the town some more.</font>

151
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:43,317
<font color="#467546">In the center, there is a large tower.</font>

152
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:46,175
<font color="#467546">On top of it, a large statue.</font>

153
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,216
<font color="#467546">Who could that be?</font>

154
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,257
<font color="#467546">It looks like a king.</font>

155
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:53,115
<font color="#467546">Should I just go into that tower?</font>

156
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,156
<font color="#467546">...</font>

157
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:58,000
<font color="#467546">Yes, I Must Go into that tower.</font>

158
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:06,042
<font color="#467546">These plants, this heat...</font>

159
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,083
<font color="#467546">It feels just like before.</font>

160
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:12,573
<font color="#467546">I want to go up, but the stairs only go down.</font>

161
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:14,614
<font color="#467546">But that doesn't really matter.</font>

162
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:19,104
<font color="#467546">For some reason, it feels like what's down here is important.</font>

163
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,962
<font color="#467546">I just have to follow this feeling.</font>

164
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:26,452
<font color="#467546">The rooms change, this one is red, this one is white,</font>

165
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:29,718
<font color="#467546">this one is black, this one is yellow...</font>

166
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,759
<font color="#467546">It's all so pretty.</font>

167
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,208
<font color="#467546">I keep going down. Further down.</font>

168
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,474
<font color="#467546">There are some puddles, but it's not water.</font>

169
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:40,332
<font color="#467546">I know I Must Not touch them.</font>

170
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,373
<font color="#954444"><i>Drip</i>...</font>

171
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,414
<font color="#954444"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

172
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,455
<font color="#954444"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

173
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,496
<font color="#467546">Ripples, circles, waves.</font>

174
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,945
<font color="#467546">But I Must Not touch them.</font>

175
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:53,394
<font color="#467546">I sit next to a puddle.</font>

176
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,843
<font color="#467546">And I look at my reflection.</font>

177
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:58,292
<font color="#467546">Do I really look like this?</font>

178
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,741
<font color="#467546">No, the puddle must be lying.</font>

179
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:05,639
<font color="#467546">I Must Not touch it, so I stand up, and keep walking.</font>

180
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:11,352
<font color="#467546">Suddenly, a storm.</font>

181
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:15,026
<font color="#467546">Below the tower, a strong wind blows sand around.</font>

182
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:19,516
<font color="#467546">The sand hurts my face, but I have to go down.</font>

183
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,374
<font color="#467546">Further down, further down. Even further down.</font>

184
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,048
<font color="#467546">But now, the only way down is to jump.</font>

185
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:29,314
<font color="#467546">It's only a small distance, but it's scary!</font>

186
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,355
<font color="#467546">I jump..</font>

187
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,396
<font color="#467546">I jump...</font>

188
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:35,437
<font color="#467546">...and land.</font>

189
00:11:35,438 --> 00:11:37,886
<font color="#467546">But, this wind is so strong...</font>

190
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,927
<font color="#467546">I tumble to the edge.</font>

191
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,968
<font color="#467546">I tumble off the edge.</font>

192
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,000
<font color="#467546">Bye-bye...</font>

193
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,042
<font color="#f1b178">Venerable lady... we did it.</font>

194
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:54,083
<font color="#f1b178">At last, the surface.</font>

195
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,532
<font color="#f1b178">To have finally reached up here...</font>

196
00:11:56,533 --> 00:12:01,022
<font color="#f1b178">These lands are always so much more perilous than they seem.</font>

197
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:03,471
<font color="#f1b178">What dangers will this grove hold?</font>

198
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,512
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You did well, child.</font>

199
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:08,370
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Your journey is almost to an end.</font>

200
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:11,228
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Do not falter in its final steps.</font>

201
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:16,535
<font color="#f1b178">I only did well because I didn't run into that <i>beast</i> this time.</font>

202
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,801
<font color="#f1b178">It was nothing but a stroke of luck.</font>

203
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:23,067
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Child, do not concern yourself with such trivialities.</font>

204
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:25,108
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">We are up here now.</font>

205
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:29,190
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You ought to feel a sense of pride for this.</font>

206
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,231
<font color="#f1b178">You are right, my lady.</font>

207
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:34,089
<font color="#f1b178">Soon, I will finally reach the Azachon.</font>

208
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,598
<font color="#f1b178">Venerable lady, I must confess.</font>

209
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,639
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Speak your heart, child.</font>

210
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,680
<font color="#f1b178">The stream stirs so silently...</font>

211
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,129
<font color="#f1b178">The springs bubble with such delight...</font>

212
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,619
<font color="#f1b178">The stars wax and wane, and the sky waves and wanders...</font>

213
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,477
<font color="#f1b178">I see such beauty in this land.</font>

214
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:56,518
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Does that surprise you?</font>

215
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,600
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Did you not expect beauty, here in the cosmic midst?</font>

216
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,641
<font color="#f1b178">I don't know.</font>

217
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:06,723
<font color="#f1b178">It's just... the things they tell back home, they're different.</font>

218
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,764
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Nonetheless, they are true.</font>

219
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:11,622
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Beauty to one is horror to another.</font>

220
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,480
<font color="#f1b178">Then, what does that say about me?</font>

221
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:17,746
<font color="#f1b178">One who finds such beauty in the defiled?</font>

222
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:22,644
<font color="#f1b178">I'm aware of its evils, and the taint that stains its sky...</font>

223
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,502
<font color="#f1b178">But I'm still inclined to love, somehow.</font>

224
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,951
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">It's all a matter of perception.</font>

225
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:31,217
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Only a right view may penetrate this illusion.</font>

226
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:33,666
<font color="#f1b178">Then do I simply lack wisdom?</font>

227
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,524
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh, dear, I'd never accuse you thereof!</font>

228
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,973
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">But indeed, you do lack wisdom.</font>

229
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

230
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,042
<font color="#954444">Incident: the disruptor.</font>

231
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:51,083
<font color="#954444">And the father said:</font>

232
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:54,757
<font color="#954444">For as long as you have known the girl,</font>

233
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:59,247
<font color="#954444">He has been amongst you, and He has prayed for you;</font>

234
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:04,554
<font color="#954444">For as long as you have seen the stars, He has ruled them.</font>

235
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:08,228
<font color="#954444">The father commanded his servants to embalm the girl.</font>

236
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:13,535
<font color="#954444">To baptize her in milk, and to offer her to the stars, faraway.</font>

237
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,984
<font color="#954444">And then her brother wept, crying:</font>

238
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:20,882
<font color="#954444">I won't let the stars steal her away, she is ours forever!</font>

239
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:22,923
<font color="#954444">This disappointed the father.</font>

240
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:24,964
<font color="#954444">He told him:</font>

241
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:29,454
<font color="#954444">She will return with the King when the time is nigh.</font>

242
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,903
<font color="#954444">When from the stars He descends.</font>

243
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,169
<font color="#954444">And when He takes our throne once more.</font>

244
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,435
<font color="#954444">With the King, we walk the world eternal.</font>

245
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:44,150
<font color="#954444">The father waved his hand, watched the sky, and made disappear all the threads.</font>

246
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:47,824
<font color="#954444">It was day; only the brightest stars were visible.</font>

247
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,865
<font color="#954444">He continued:</font>

248
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:52,314
<font color="#954444">This is our kingdom, my child.</font>

249
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:56,396
<font color="#954444">Whatever may disappear is never gone, such is the sky.</font>

250
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,773
<font color="#954444">Record: the last communion.</font>

251
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,814
<font color="#954444">And the father said:</font>

252
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,855
<font color="#954444">The Day awaits us.</font>

253
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:12,345
<font color="#954444">The holy rite of the King and Queen will soon commence.</font>

254
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:17,243
<font color="#954444">I hereby urge you, who comprise the Kingdom under the sacred Crown,</font>

255
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,284
<font color="#954444">Unite!</font>

256
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,325
<font color="#954444">Earth and Sky have settled,</font>

257
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:25,407
<font color="#954444">the stars have aligned to open the path to quintessence.</font>

258
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:29,489
<font color="#954444">We shall abandon our dwellings, and delve under the waters:</font>

259
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,755
<font color="#954444">for the Great Cathedral will house the rite,</font>

260
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:35,613
<font color="#954444">tomorrow at the time of the solstice.</font>

261
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:39,287
<font color="#954444">Fate has it that you will all arrive tomorrow,</font>

262
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,736
<font color="#954444">for the day is our destiny:</font>

263
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:43,777
<font color="#954444">We all have been chosen.</font>

264
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,635
<font color="#954444">We all must choose to embrace it.</font>

265
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,000
<font color="#954444">(There are no further records.)</font>

266
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,042
<font color="#954444">To whom it may concern,</font>

267
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:05,308
<font color="#954444">We have heard some Brothers express doubts recently.</font>

268
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,166
<font color="#954444">Hearing this fills me with profound sadness.</font>

269
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,248
<font color="#954444">But, while it goes without saying, remember your Masters' teachings.</font>

270
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,963
<font color="#954444">Surely, you are aware of the consequences of denouncing the League in this manner.</font>

271
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,663
<font color="#954444">For eons, we have upheld tradition, awaiting this moment.</font>

272
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:28,561
<font color="#954444">Thousands of our ancestors did not live to see this glorious day,</font>

273
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:31,827
<font color="#954444">but our patience has been rewarded at last.</font>

274
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:36,725
<font color="#954444">We shall welcome the herald of a new era in twenty-seven days.</font>

275
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:40,399
<font color="#954444">I must emphasize the importance of upholding tradition henceforth.</font>

276

278
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:55,896

<font color="#954444">Come!</font>

280
00:16:57,938 --> 00:17:00,795

281
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:04,469
<font color="#954444">you shall surely be convinced he is our King.</font>

282
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,735

283
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,001
<font color="#954444">Hereafter, the Stars shall continue to guide us.</font>

284
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:15,083
<font color="#954444">Even if we cannot see them, we shall follow them.</font>

285
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,941
<font color="#954444">When the sky is obscured, consult quintessence.</font>

286
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:21,615
<font color="#954444">If ever you are in doubt, rely on tradition.</font>

287
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,723
<font color="#954444">Finally, we will be restructuring certain ranks within the League.</font>

<font color="#467546">And I can actually... relax here.</font>

414
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:36,088
<font color="#467546">I know I shouldn't let my guard down though.</font>

415
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,354
<font color="#467546">With all the beasts up there and whatnot.</font>

416
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:42,212
<font color="#467546">Not to mention the Eye's incessant demands.</font>

417
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:45,478
<font color="#467546">But here, I can finally take a breather...</font>

418
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:50,559
<font color="#467546">Still, it really messes with me.</font>

419
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,417
<font color="#467546">Who am I? What is this place?</font>

420
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:57,907
<font color="#467546">This sky has no sun... but it feels like it should.</font>

421
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:01,173
<font color="#467546">There is just no sense of time here.</font>

422
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:05,663
<font color="#467546">And having to be on my guard, always, is so taxing.</font>

423
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:10,561
<font color="#467546">But in these ravines, I can hardly see the sky at all.</font>

424
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:13,419
<font color="#467546">Without that eerie twilight in my view...</font>

425
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,868
<font color="#467546">Without the beasts that roam around...</font>

426
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,909
<font color="#467546">Let's take a nap...</font>

427
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,990
<font color="#467546">Why do I always forget dreams?</font>

428
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:25,848
<font color="#467546">I feel like this one was important.</font>

429
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,889
<font color="#467546">Funny how that works.</font>

430
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,930
<font color="#467546">Well then. Well now.</font>

431
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:34,000
<font color="#467546">Let's see if I can Remember anything around these parts.</font>

437
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,269
<font color="#954444">That on this accursed Day, I were to teach you Death.</font>

438

00:26:46,528 --> 00:26:50,201
<font color="#954444">Act 4: You shall not speak to the quintessence.</font>

<font color="#954444">Act 5: You shall not listen to the quintessence.</font>

487

<font color="#954444">Act 6: You shall not lay your eyes upon the quintessence.</font>

<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no hatred,</font>

493
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,890
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no emptiness,</font>

494
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:29,339

495
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,605
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no loneliness,</font>

496
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:36,279
<font color="#954444">For we all shall be one and the same.</font>

497
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,545
<font color="#954444">Oh Quintessence, open our eyes to this truth.</font>

498
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:51,083
<font color="#467546">...let's break this stained glass and get out of here.</font>

499
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:53,532
<font color="#467546">I can't stand this "quintessence" stuff.</font>

500
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,573
<font color="#467546">A good three whacks, and...</font>

501
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,614
<font color="#467546">the window shatters.</font>

502
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:01,696
<font color="#467546">The liquid doesn't even spill, it just floats in place.</font>

503
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:05,370
<font color="#467546">After climbing through, my face meets warm, subterranean air.</font>

504
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,452
<font color="#467546">All my senses are under constant attack in this cavern.</font>

505
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,493
<font color="#467546">Most jarringly, hearing.</font>

506
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:15,575
<font color="#467546">What causes these reverberations? What is all of this noise?</font>

507
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:18,024
<font color="#467546">Do those glowing plants cause it?</font>

508
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:20,882
<font color="#467546">Do they also cause this rotten smell?</font>

509
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:27,404
<font color="#467546">In the middle of this cavern is this huge pillar.</font>

510
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:30,262
<font color="#467546">Near the top, it splits into four.</font>

511
00:28:30,263 --> 00:28:33,528
<font color="#467546">And then each branch, again, splits into four.</font>

512
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,386
<font color="#467546">A beautiful coral turning in on itself.</font>

513
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:41,693
<font color="#467546">Like that cathedral just now, it's made of that same sickly yellow rock.</font>

514
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:44,959
<font color="#467546">I'm all too familiar with it by now.</font>

515
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,000
<font color="#467546">With the same green growths...</font>

516
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:51,082
<font color="#467546">I'm also all too familiar with that stuff by now.</font>

517
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:53,531
<font color="#467546">The fissures look somewhat like writing.</font>

518
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,980
<font color="#467546">Of course, I cannot read it.</font>

519
00:28:55,981 --> 00:29:00,062
<font color="#467546">I look down. The pillar goes into a lake below.</font>

520
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:03,736
<font color="#467546">And then, it burrows even deeper into the ground.</font>

521
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:08,226
<font color="#467546">The lake seems to contain the same stuff as everywhere else.</font>

522
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:12,308
<font color="#467546">From this high up, the crimson liquid seems to twinkle.</font>

523
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:14,349
<font color="#467546">Twinkling like the stars outside.</font>

524
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,390
<font color="#467546">It's almost inviting.</font>

525
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:18,431
<font color="#467546">But I Must Not.</font>

526
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:22,105
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look around the rest of the cave.</font>

527
00:29:22,106 --> 00:29:25,371
<font color="#467546">There are four bridges extending from the pillar.</font>

528
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:30,678
<font color="#467546">The center seems as good a place as any to set up camp.</font>

529
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:40,000
<font color="#467546">This place is pleasing to the senses.</font>

530
00:29:46,002 --> 00:29:48,042
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

531
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:51,716
<font color="#954444">I begged her to never open her eyes again.</font>

532
00:29:51,717 --> 00:29:56,206
<font color="#954444">Whatever she dreams of is not fit for one so innocent.</font>

533
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:58,247
<font color="#954444">Her spasms when asleep...</font>

534
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,288
<font color="#954444">Her demeanor when awake...</font>

535
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,962
<font color="#954444">I pray to you, let those dreams be dreams.</font>

536
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:06,820
<font color="#954444">No one deserves to suffer through that.</font>

537
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:12,535
<font color="#954444">While my daughter has yet the ability to smile, allow her to do so.</font>

538
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:15,393
<font color="#954444">I beg of you, Queen of Starlight...</font>

539
00:30:19,924 --> 00:30:24,821
<font color="#954444">When I first found her, I saw faint starlight in her eyes.</font>

540
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:28,087
<font color="#954444">I knew for certain she was the one.</font>

541
00:30:28,088 --> 00:30:30,945
<font color="#954444">Initially, I chose her for her talent,</font>

542
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:36,252
<font color="#954444">but now I can only see someone I have to protect from themselves.</font>

543
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:40,334
<font color="#954444">I can only muster so much dedication in a lifetime.</font>

544
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:44,824
<font color="#954444">A single pupil is enough to last me until my death.</font>

545
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:50,539
<font color="#954444">I hope that she understands that, even if not by blood, she's my child.</font>

546
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,988
<font color="#954444">And I love her for it.</font>

547
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,600
<font color="#954444">And now, the time has come for me to choose.</font>

548
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,641
<font color="#954444">Will I protect my daughter?</font>

549
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:06,907
<font color="#954444">Or will I stay true to my creed?</font>

550
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,948
<font color="#954444">I have always been loyal.</font>

551
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,214
<font color="#954444">So I beg of you, Queen of Starlight.</font>

552
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,255
<font color="#954444">Whatever my choice may be.</font>

553
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:17,521
<font color="#954444">Whether I become a sinner or a saint...</font>

554
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,970
<font color="#954444">Please accept my decision with grace.</font>

555
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, a lowly researcher.</font>

556
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:30,042
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

557
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:33,716
<font color="#954444">I've lied to her ever since I knew her.</font>

558
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:36,574
<font color="#954444">Yet it was all for her sake.</font>

559
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:41,472
<font color="#954444">And for as long as she didn't notice, she was indeed happy.</font>

560
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:46,370
<font color="#954444">For thirteen years, she was the happiest girl I had ever seen.</font>

561
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,819
<font color="#954444">I couldn't have asked for more.</font>

562
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:53,022
<font color="#954444">However,</font>

563
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:57,104
<font color="#954444">As her mental condition deteriorated, the lies failed to uphold.</font>

564
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:59,553
<font color="#954444">Lately, she acted out in rage.</font>

565
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:03,635
<font color="#954444">I had to confine her before it was too late.</font>

566
00:32:03,636 --> 00:32:06,084
<font color="#954444">Rather understandably, she hates me now.</font>

567
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:08,125
<font color="#954444">...</font>

568
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,391
<font color="#954444">My own daughter earnestly wishes for my disappearance.</font>

569
00:32:11,392 --> 00:32:16,698
<font color="#954444">If it continues like this, it won't be long before the world notices.</font>

570
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:19,964
<font color="#954444">I committed acts not worthy of your ears.</font>

571
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:26,087
<font color="#954444">The quintessence in her eyes kept on pouring, and so I became overwhelmed with distress.</font>

572
00:32:26,088 --> 00:32:28,536
<font color="#954444">They had to be shut forever.</font>

573
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:30,577
<font color="#954444">...</font>

574
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,597
<font color="#954444">But even half-blind, she managed to escape.</font>

575
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:38,455
<font color="#954444">I reckon this verdict pleases you greatly.</font>

576
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,721
<font color="#954444">This marks your very own birth, after all.</font>

577
00:32:41,722 --> 00:32:46,619
<font color="#954444">As for me, I don't think I can continue on any longer.</font>

578
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,068
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I love;</font>

579
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:51,517
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I worship;</font>

580
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:54,375
<font color="#954444">and in doing so, I've betrayed myself.</font>

581
00:32:54,376 --> 00:33:00,906
<font color="#954444">I'll just let her be from now on. Perhaps she will find happiness on her own.</font>

582
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:02,947
<font color="#954444">So.</font>

583
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,988
<font color="#954444">Queen of Starlight, my daughter.</font>

584
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:07,029
<font color="#954444">Like this we will part.</font>

585
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,111
<font color="#954444">I pray for you to one day reach an end,</font>

586
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:13,969
<font color="#954444">just as I will soon reach mine.</font>

587
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, ...</font>

588
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,859
<font color="#467546">A library, in these caves? How exciting.</font>

589
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,308
<font color="#467546">Where to start, where to start...</font>

590
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:31,736
<font color="#467546">"Satvatapatvi"... "Ausrapatvi"...</font>

591
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:36,634
<font color="#467546">What use is a great library if I don't know these languages...</font>

592
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:38,675
<font color="#467546">Ah, here we go!</font>

593
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:41,124
<font color="#467546">Still can't read the title, but...</font>

594
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,165
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The shepherd</font>

595
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,206
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The dreamer</font>

596
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,247
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The wise</font>

597
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:50,105
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The Shepherds of the Stars foresaw it.</font>

598
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:54,595
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The birth of a new King amongst a sea of fakes.</font>

599
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:57,453
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Her name, Soeise, third King of man.</font>

600
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,902
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">She was raised in peaceful meadows,</font>

601
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:03,984
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">and full of love for every sound and every flower;</font>

602
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:07,658
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">every insect, every leaf; every tree and every droplet;</font>

603
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,699
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">every star, every rock; every...</font>

604
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,965
<font color="#467546">...This seems to go on for a while.</font>

605
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,006
<font color="#467546">...</font>

606
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:19,496
<font color="#467546">So apparently she dreamt herself all the way to the stars.</font>

607
00:34:19,497 --> 00:34:23,986
<font color="#467546">Whatever that means. And she was the first to do so.</font>

608
00:34:23,987 --> 00:34:27,660
<font color="#467546">Her dreams started to turn people around her mad.</font>

609
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:30,518
<font color="#467546">But despite all that, it's praising her...</font>

610
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,559
<font color="#467546">fiscal responsibility?</font>

611
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,600
<font color="#467546">...I'm grabbing another book.</font>

612
00:34:36,988 --> 00:34:39,845
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">On the horizon, the tower grew tall.</font>

613
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:44,335
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">With its end in sight, so came our end in sight.</font>

614
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:48,417
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But born when all hope was lost, a pirate's son.</font>

615
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,499
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">The fourth King of man, Teonan, raised by bastard thugs.</font>

616
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,173
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">He had but His mother's flute to take refuge.</font>

617
00:34:56,174 --> 00:34:59,439
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But when He had even that taken away,</font>

618
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,297
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">when father killed mother, He killed all.</font>

619
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:04,338
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Wrought with grief and sorrow,</font>

620
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,196
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">wrought with a desire to rewind time,</font>

621
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,645
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">wrought with a feeling of regret,</font>

622
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:12,094
<font color="#467546">These books really like repeating themselves.</font>

623
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:14,543
<font color="#467546">Okay, quickly going through the rest...</font>

624
00:35:14,544 --> 00:35:17,809
<font color="#467546">He's sad, he's not sad, he's sad again,</font>

625
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,667
<font color="#467546">other people find out he's the king,</font>

626
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,525
<font color="#467546">he has to make some difficult decisions,</font>

627
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:25,566
<font color="#467546">and then he's sad again.</font>

628
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,000
<font color="#467546">...I'm done sifting through these books.</font>

629
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:36,042
<font color="#954444">Quintessence.</font>

630
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:39,308
<font color="#954444">If only we could understand Its true potential.</font>

631
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,349
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Remember your Master's Master?</font>

632
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,390
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">She advanced our understanding greatly.</font>

633
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,064
<font color="#954444">We have certainly been able to increase Its purity.</font>

634
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:51,554
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Is your task then not the same? Follow in her footsteps.</font>

635
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:55,228
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Give us an even better view of the Starlight.</font>

636
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:58,902
<font color="#954444">You only want that for your own, selfish purposes.</font>

637
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:00,943
<font color="#954444">Am I not right?</font>

638
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:02,984
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">...</font>

639
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:08,698
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">How have you been? It has been a while.</font>

640
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,739
<font color="#954444">Oh, it's only you.</font>

641
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,597
<font color="#954444">Have your rotten eyes finally failed you?</font>

642
00:36:13,598 --> 00:36:16,455
<font color="#954444">I am busy. Do not disturb me.</font>

643
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,496
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Cold as ever.</font>

644
00:36:18,497 --> 00:36:20,537
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">You ignored the League's call.</font>

645
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:22,578
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Are you truly that busy?</font>

646
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:25,436
<font color="#954444">Did your Master not raise you properly?</font>

647
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:27,477
<font color="#954444">"Devote oneself to the Starlight."</font>

648
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:30,335
<font color="#954444">You are a disgrace to our discipline.</font>

649
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:34,009
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Yet <i>you</i> are the one who ignored the League.</font>

650
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,050
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">No research can justify that.</font>

651
00:36:36,051 --> 00:36:38,091
<font color="#954444">I can taste the Starlight.</font>

652
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:42,172
<font color="#954444">This liquid is truly marvellous.</font>

653
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:44,621
<font color="#954444">I can see the stars twinkle.</font>

654
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:47,479
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I see your condition has worsened again.</font>

655
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,786
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">You really are on the right path. It seems you drew their ire.</font>

656
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:56,052
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I heard they took over the other day?</font>

657
00:36:56,053 --> 00:36:58,093
<font color="#954444">Ah yes...</font>

658
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:02,175
<font color="#954444">The voices managed to break a few bones. Nothing more.</font>

659
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:05,849
<font color="#954444">Barely significant compared to those growths on my leg.</font>

660
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,298
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Have you tried watering them yet?</font>

661
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:10,339
<font color="#954444">Very funny...</font>

662
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,380
<font color="#954444">...</font>

663
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:17,278

664
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,727
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">This has long been conventional wisdom.</font>

665
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:22,993
<font color="#954444">My mind is falling apart, I <i>need</i> this.</font>

666
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:26,259
<font color="#954444">I see glimpses of Starlight in my peripheral!</font>

667
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,117
<font color="#954444">Like my Master's Master! I <i>need</i> this!</font>

668
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:31,975
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">It is an inevitability of our research.</font>

669
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:36,873
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">But it is always so sad to see a dear friend go.</font>

670
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:40,139
<font color="#954444">I will not let those angels stop me.</font>

671
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,854
<font color="#954444">I am <i>so</i> close to reaching The Inner. <b>Lend me a hand.</b></font>

672
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:49,935
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Truly unfortunate.</font>

673
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,384
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Only a pile of mush remains.</font>

674
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,425
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">Their study, inaccessible. "Spores".</font>

675
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:57,691
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">They did not even leave a disciple behind.</font>

676
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,957
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">I must thank my Master for her wisdom.</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">"Do not lose sight of yourself during research."</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">"If they win, your work will be for naught."</font>

679
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:11,979

680
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">My voices are only faint.</font>

681
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:22,042
<font color="#467546">What a view.</font>

682
00:38:24,985 --> 00:38:27,025
<font color="#467546">So apparently, the world ends.</font>

683
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:29,066
<font color="#467546">Quite quickly, in fact.</font>

684
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:31,924
<font color="#467546">Here I am, sitting on the ledge.</font>

685
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,965
<font color="#467546">Gazing into the void.</font>

686
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:38,047
<font color="#467546">Nothing but the purple twilight that's become nostalgic by now.</font>

687
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:40,905
<font color="#467546">And the stars... They're so very pretty.</font>

688
00:38:40,906 --> 00:38:44,171
<font color="#467546">How they pulse, oscillate, fade in, fade out.</font>

689
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:47,029
<font color="#467546">To think that they could read these...</font>

690
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,295
<font color="#467546">Wouldn't it be nice if I could, too?</font>

691
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:55,278
<font color="#467546">What was it like, before?</font>

692
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:58,544
<font color="#467546">Before I woke up in those floating towers?</font>

693
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:03,034
<font color="#467546">I know there probably isn't a "before", but I can dream.</font>

694
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:06,708
<font color="#467546">Could the night sky before have been this pretty?</font>

695
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,099
<font color="#467546">I've been slowly satiating the Eye.</font>

696
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,181
<font color="#467546">In return, It blesses me with Memories that aren't mine.</font>

697
00:39:16,182 --> 00:39:18,630
<font color="#467546">Things are gradually falling into place.</font>

698
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:23,120
<font color="#467546">Things are starting to make sense, in their own, twisted way.</font>

699
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:25,161
<font color="#467546">But I still don't understand.</font>

700
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,610
<font color="#467546">Why did I wake up here?</font>

701
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:30,059
<font color="#467546">Who am I? Why am I?</font>

702
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:35,859
<font color="#467546">This one idiom suddenly comes to mind...</font>

703
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,900
<font color="#467546">The "call of the void"?</font>

704
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:41,574
<font color="#467546">I've never heard it before... but it feels right.</font>

705
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:44,840
<font color="#467546">There is no "bottom" below my feet here.</font>

706
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,881
<font color="#467546">Everything just becomes hazy.</font>

707
00:39:46,882 --> 00:39:48,922
<font color="#467546">Everything just loses definition.</font>

708
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:53,004
<font color="#467546">This morbid curiosity of wanting to know what's down there.</font>

709
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,045
<font color="#467546">Or what <i>isn't</i> down there.</font>

710
00:39:57,988 --> 00:40:02,477
<font color="#467546">From the empty void, a lukewarm breeze flows through my hair.</font>

711
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:04,518
<font color="#467546">Where does it come from?</font>

712
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,559
<font color="#467546">...</font>

713
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,457
<font color="#467546">Heh, I should've learnt to stop questioning things like that long ago.</font>

714
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:16,764
<font color="#467546">The bugs tried their best, but there's so much they did not teach.</font>

715
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:22,071
<font color="#467546">Every time I think I figure something out, this place surprises me again.</font>

716
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:27,378
<font color="#467546">But this place, the entire thing, feels a little like a "home", now.</font>

717
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:29,419
<font color="#467546">Somehow.</font>

718
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,909
<font color="#467546">For all of its faults, it really is a beautiful home.</font>

719
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,892
<font color="#467546">Enough monologuing.</font>

720
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:42,974
<font color="#467546">No one here to listen to me babble on anyways.</font>

721
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#467546">Let's get moving again.</font>

722
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:55,491
<font color="#467546">Yuck, the quintessence in these caves is so much more potent.</font>

723
00:40:55,492 --> 00:40:57,532
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">▓▒y ▓██▓▒▓▒ you r▓▒▓██▓red ██▓...</font>

725
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:03,247
<font color="#467546">They're creepy.</font>

726
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:07,737
<font color="#467546">I guess I should consider myself lucky I don't understand them.</font>

729
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,193
<font color="#467546">Why were these guys so obsessed with the stuff?</font>

730
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:20,234
<font color="#467546">They seemed to deify it.</font>

731
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:22,683
<font color="#467546">From what I could understand, anyway.</font>

732
00:41:22,684 --> 00:41:26,357
<font color="#467546">So many books I find are decayed beyond belief.</font>

733
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:30,031

753
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,498
<font color="#467546">It's really pretty how it twinkles.</font>

754
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:32,580
<font color="#467546">Especially in the dark, it turns into a night sky.</font>

755
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:34,621
<font color="#467546">An alien night sky.</font>

00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,042

761
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:56,083
<font color="#467546">That swamp was bad enough,</font>

762
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,941
<font color="#467546">but here it's covering the entire cavern!</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But...</font>

817
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,369
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">...</font>

818
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:55,222
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But my daughter, is she still there?</font>

819
00:45:55,223 --> 00:45:58,080
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">What did you do to my daughter?!</font>

820
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:00,121
<font color="#428686">Breathe in, child.</font>

821
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:02,570
<font color="#428686">See there, her heart of marble.</font>

822
00:46:02,571 --> 00:46:04,611
<font color="#428686">She still loves you, child.</font>

823
00:46:04,612 --> 00:46:07,060
<font color="#428686">And with love, she shall conquer.</font>

824
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:09,509
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But is she not the Harbinger?</font>

825
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,367
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Whose sword sheds the blood of nations,</font>

826
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:15,225
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">whose voice judges the fate of kings...</font>

827
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:17,266
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Is she not ages-old?</font>

828
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,307
<font color="#428686">Indeed, she is!</font>

829
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:22,981
<font color="#428686">But you yourself, before your birth, were you naught?</font>

830
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:25,022
<font color="#428686">Are you not ages-old, too?</font>

831
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,063
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I might be...</font>

832
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,104
<font color="#428686">And have you not killed?</font>

833
00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:31,145
<font color="#428686">Have you not judged?</font>

834
00:46:31,146 --> 00:46:33,186
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">That I have...</font>

835
00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:41,319
<font color="#428686">Do away with your illusions, child.</font>

836
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,401
<font color="#428686">To love her rightly is to love all of her.</font>

837
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,259
<font color="#428686">Whether girl or harbinger, innocent or cruel.</font>

838
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,300
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I understand, venerable lady.</font>

839
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:52,749
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But I still need some time.</font>

840
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,790
<font color="#428686">Do as you will.</font>

841
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:58,056
<font color="#428686">The Azachon is within you, stand and gaze!</font>

842
00:46:58,057 --> 00:47:01,322
<font color="#428686">Gaze at what the Heavens have gifted you!</font>

843
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:15,042
<font color="#467546">I hate these caves.</font>

844
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,900
<font color="#467546">They are large, hot, labyrinthine, and worse,</font>

845
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,758
<font color="#467546">so much more dangerous than those wetlands.</font>

846
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:24,432
<font color="#467546">I've only Remembered what, like eight Memories so far?</font>

847
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:28,106
<font color="#467546">If only this place was a little more reasonable...</font>

848
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:30,964
<font color="#467546">I would've long completed this stupid task.</font>

849
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:36,271
<font color="#467546">But I've agreed to it, so for the Eye's sake, I Must Continue.</font>

850
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:39,129
<font color="#467546">Not much else to do here, anyway.</font>

851
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,170
<font color="#467546">...</font>

852
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:46,068
<font color="#467546">But I feel like I've found everything these caves have to offer.</font>

853
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:50,150
<font color="#467546">There's that river, that cathedral, that <i>thing</i> in the center,</font>

854
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:54,232
<font color="#467546">that fungus place, that palace that gives me the creeps...</font>

855
00:47:54,233 --> 00:47:56,273
<font color="#467546">None lead me further.</font>

856
00:47:56,274 --> 00:48:00,763
<font color="#467546">Surely I don't have to dig my way down, do I?</font>

857
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:06,973
<font color="#467546">Finally...</font>

858
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,831
<font color="#467546">I've been wandering these caves for ages,</font>

859
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:12,280
<font color="#467546">turning every stone like a madman...</font>

860
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:14,321
<font color="#467546">Why here, of all places!</font>

861
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:16,770
<font color="#467546">Ah, finally something to do again!</font>

862
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,797
<font color="#467546">Who put these traps in these ruins!</font>

863
00:48:23,798 --> 00:48:27,063
<font color="#467546">It makes no sense how they still work!</font>

864
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:32,778
<font color="#467546">This place looks like it's designed to do one thing, and one thing only:</font>

865
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,819
<font color="#467546">Kill. Specifically, me.</font>

866
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,493
<font color="#467546">Moreso than any other place I've been, at least.</font>

867
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:41,351
<font color="#467546">Usually the wildlife is the dangerous part...</font>

868
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:46,249
<font color="#467546">But here, the floor collapses, I get shot at out of nowhere...</font>

869
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,515
<font color="#467546">I've even had the ceiling fall on me!</font>

870
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:52,373
<font color="#467546">This infernal heat is also something else.</font>

871
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:56,047
<font color="#467546">I really can't focus on my surroundings like this.</font>

872
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:59,313
<font color="#467546">To think I found those caves too dangerous...</font>

873
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:02,171
<font color="#467546">They pale in comparison to this place.</font>

874
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:07,069
<font color="#467546">I honestly want to take a break, go back to those wetlands...</font>

875
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,518
<font color="#467546">and just <i>relax</i> for a moment.</font>

876
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,600
<font color="#467546">Or perhaps, those gardens. Those are a bit closer by.</font>

877
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:17,682
<font color="#467546">(But then I'd need to go through that palace again...)</font>

878
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:25,525
<font color="#467546">I do see the beauty of places like this.</font>

879
00:49:25,526 --> 00:49:27,566
<font color="#467546">Really, I do.</font>

880
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:31,240
<font color="#467546">It's just, harder, when they're trying to kill me!</font>

881
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,506
<font color="#467546">It seems like I've reached the end though.</font>

882
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:36,547
<font color="#467546">This door is huge, and...</font>

883
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:38,588
<font color="#467546">I Sense Someone Behind It.</font>

884
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:40,629
<font color="#467546">Another, normal, living being.</font>

885
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,670
<font color="#467546">Sigh.</font>

886
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:45,936
<font color="#467546">Of course the halfway point is being guarded.</font>

887
00:49:45,937 --> 00:49:47,977
<font color="#467546">Why wouldn't it be?</font>

888
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:50,000
<font color="#467546">I'm ready. Let's go.</font>

889
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:58,450
<font color="#eefc9a">What to name our son, milord?</font>

890
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,491
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...</font>

891
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:03,349
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">He shall be Lord of the Earth,</font>

892
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,431
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">the lion whose claws shall quench the fires of Hell,</font>

893
00:50:07,432 --> 00:50:09,880
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">who bestows upon man their wings.</font>

894
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,329
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">So His name shall be Ariel,</font>

895
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,003
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">and the Old Earth shall run through His veins.</font>

896
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:18,044
<font color="#eefc9a">"Ariel"... Beautiful, milord.</font>

897
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:20,902
<font color="#eefc9a">Look at his eyes, aren’t they magical?</font>

898
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:22,943
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ice-white, like yours once were.</font>

899
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:26,617
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">See? All is as told; He is our King.</font>

900
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:30,291
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">And you have always been destined to bear Him.</font>

901
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:32,332
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

902
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,598
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The pilgrims are here. The gates shall open.</font>

903
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,680
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Sing Him a song, and wear your mask with grace.</font>

904
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:44,608
<font color="#eefc9a">Little Ariel, how softly your heart beats...</font>

905
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:47,466
<font color="#eefc9a">Your blank little heart, free from desire.</font>

906
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:49,507
<font color="#eefc9a">May it remain pure forevermore.</font>

907
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,548
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

908
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:56,446
<font color="#eefc9a">I pray you will grow up a better man than your father.</font>

909
00:50:58,517 --> 00:51:00,557
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Greetings, wife. How is Ariel?</font>

910
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:05,864
<font color="#eefc9a">Come in, dear! Oh how I’ve missed you. How was your time at-</font>

911
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:07,905
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Answer me. How is Ariel?</font>

912
00:51:07,906 --> 00:51:11,987
<font color="#eefc9a">He walks and he talks, he reads and he writes...</font>

913
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:14,436
<font color="#eefc9a">He even reflects on his meditations.</font>

914
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:17,702
<font color="#eefc9a">He is growing into a wise prince, milord.</font>

915
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:20,968
<font color="#eefc9a">And yet, the curse has not taken him.</font>

916
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:24,234
<font color="#eefc9a">He is perfect, milord. And so, so lovely.</font>

917
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:26,275
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Good. But remember:</font>

918
00:51:26,276 --> 00:51:28,724
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Do not get attached to Him.</font>

919
00:51:28,725 --> 00:51:32,806
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">His might far exceeds our own. <b>Do not forget this</b>.</font>

920
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:35,664
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Soon, the young Messiah will join me.</font>

921
00:51:35,665 --> 00:51:37,705
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Prepare Him for His travels.</font>

922
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:40,971
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Teach Him the words. Do not disappoint me.</font>

923
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,000
<font color="#eefc9a">Understood, milord.</font>

924
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel, attend to your studies at once!</font>

925
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:51,113
<font color="#f1b178">No. This is where Mother sat.</font>

926
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:54,114
<font color="#f1b178">She was dreaming, father. And then, you...</font>

927
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:56,257
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">How oft must I reiterate!</font>

928
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:58,400
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Enough of this attachment!</font>

929
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:01,401
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The King must ascend above His Kingdom.</font>

930
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:06,544
<font color="#f1b178">"...Ascend above The Kingdom, to cradle it from the clouds", said Teonan.</font>

931
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:09,973
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Silence! Do not talk back at me, Ariel.</font>

932
00:52:09,974 --> 00:52:12,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Go and reflect on your actions.</font>

933
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,601
<font color="#f1b178">Go and reflect on how you slit Mother's throat, father.</font>

934
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,849
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...Ariel. I have the League in my reins.</font>

935
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,285
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Without the League, you are <b>nothing</b>.</font>

936
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,533
<font color="#f1b178">Without your League, I am still the King.</font>

937
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,187
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel. Know that half the world wishes you dead.</font>

938
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,623
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The League is your sole refuge.</font>

939
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:36,495
<font color="#f1b178">If half the world wishes me dead, then let them kill me.</font>

940
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:39,743
<font color="#f1b178">I’ll become a martyr for the other half.</font>

941
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:45,021
<font color="#f1b178">The whole world shall sing my name toward the pike impaling your head.</font>

942
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:47,051
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You wasteful, manic imbecile.</font>

943
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,705
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Thousands of lives lie wasted within your livid mind.</font>

944
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:52,735
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You remember nothing, don’t you?!</font>

945
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,765
<font color="#f1b178">I do, father.</font>

946
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,201
<font color="#f1b178">"You shall perish of hunger, father."</font>

947
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:59,231
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Shut your mouth!</font>

948
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:02,479
<font color="#f1b178">"And your blood shall stain the desert storms."</font>

949
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,915
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">I’ll make you a martyr, alright!</font>

950
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,975
<font color="#f1b178">"You were a beast, and you shall die as such."</font>

951
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,000
<font color="#f1b178">Farewell, father.</font>

952
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:17,094
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">So, in the end, it was all a lie.</font>

953
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:21,992
<font color="#f1b178">That's right. But it wasn't all for naught; 'cause I met you.</font>

954
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:24,850
<font color="#f1b178">And with that, all the world's beauty.</font>

955
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:28,524
<font color="#f1b178">Do you hear the seagulls hovering over your head?</font>

956
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:31,790
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">And the sun rays shearing over the sea...</font>

957
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:35,056
<font color="#f1b178">And the fresh air breezing through your lungs...</font>

958
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:39,954
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">I'm proud to share these feelings with you, false King of Man.</font>

959
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:43,628
<font color="#f1b178">Hey, watch your mouth, you piss-poor horse-herder.</font>

960
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:45,669
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Thank you.</font>

961
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,710
<font color="#f1b178">No problem, brother.</font>

962
00:53:49,502 --> 00:53:51,950
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Look, Ariel, the sky has opened.</font>

963
00:53:51,951 --> 00:53:53,991
<font color="#f1b178">Unbelievable... Shall we stargaze?</font>

964
00:53:53,992 --> 00:53:58,481
<font color="#f1b178">And read each other's fates, as did the Kings of old?</font>

965
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:02,563
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Intimate, isn't it? Surely, we too shall fall in love.</font>

966
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,395
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">You know, Ariel.</font>

967
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:10,069
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">In another life, this could've been my journey's end.</font>

968
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,927
<font color="#f1b178">It can still be. Join me, Sal.</font>

969
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:17,825
<font color="#f1b178">Join me to the Holy Land, and let's find peace there. Together.</font>

970
00:54:17,826 --> 00:54:20,274
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Hmm... What do the stars foretell?</font>

971
00:54:20,275 --> 00:54:23,540
<font color="#f1b178">Damned be the stars. Choose your own path!</font>

972
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:28,030
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">But the Starlight is my path, Ariel, and you know that.</font>

973
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:32,679
<font color="#f1b178">Burning ambition and maniacal confusion.</font>

974
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,537
<font color="#f1b178">That's what I see in your path.</font>

975
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:40,844
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sounds quite exciting to me. If that's my fate, then so be it.</font>

976
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,293
<font color="#f1b178">What a stubborn man you are.</font>

977
00:54:43,294 --> 00:54:45,334
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Don’t worry, Ariel.</font>

978
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:49,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Our fates may diverge, but this night is ours!</font>

979
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,878
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, by the stars, I should have known!</font>

980
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,010
<font color="#f1b178">By the charm in his forever-smile,</font>

981
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,497
<font color="#f1b178">by the splendor in his stilted speech,</font>

982
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,984
<font color="#f1b178">by the shimmer in his somber eyes...</font>

983
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:04,761
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known!</font>

984
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:08,314
<font color="#f1b178">I loved him, I loved him, I loved him dearly.</font>

985
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:11,512
<font color="#f1b178">That man with a mind serene as the stars,</font>

986
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:15,776
<font color="#f1b178">that man who dreamed to wed himself to life and its beauty.</font>

987
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:18,971
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, then, that he was still...</font>

988
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:22,645
<font color="#f1b178">that bloodied cripple, who walked the meadows in mania.</font>

989
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,094
<font color="#f1b178">Cradling his kingdom from the clouds,</font>

990
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:27,952
<font color="#f1b178">to drown it in its own blood;</font>

991
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,401
<font color="#f1b178">he is rotten to the bone.</font>

992
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,891
<font color="#f1b178">I hate you, Sal. I hate every single one of you.</font>

993
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:41,204
<font color="#f1b178">Mother, I am hating, forgive me.</font>

994
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,062
<font color="#f1b178">My son, I am hating, hear me.</font>

995
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:46,920
<font color="#f1b178">My daughter, I am hating, cleanse me.</font>

996
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,186
<font color="#f1b178">My wife, I am hating, stand with me.</font>

997
00:55:50,187 --> 00:55:52,227
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

998
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:55,493
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I am hating, come to me.</font>

999
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:59,570
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I shall not hate, for I shall fight.</font>

1000
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,611
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, hear my prayer!</font>

1001
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:06,612
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You've finally made it, prince Ariel.</font>

1002
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,653
<font color="#f1b178">...greetings, venerable lady.</font>

1003
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:11,919
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh poor thing, such stillness in your voice.</font>

1004
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,001
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Have you seen your own eyes? How dejected, how determined.</font>

1005
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:18,859
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">The journey. What did it cost you?</font>

1006
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,900
<font color="#f1b178">Everything, venerable lady.</font>

1007
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:22,941
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Excellent. I know enough.</font>

1008
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:25,390
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You, Ariel, will be my apprentice.</font>

1009
00:56:25,391 --> 00:56:27,431
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Now bow.</font>

1010
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,472
<font color="#f1b178">Thank you, venerable lady.</font>

1011
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,513
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Welcome to our crusade, Ariel.</font>

1012
00:56:31,514 --> 00:56:36,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Death to the King. Death to his Kingdom. Hail the Azachon.</font>

1013
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:43,814
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1014
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:47,488
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

1015
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:51,162
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1016
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,020
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Father, we hear footsteps in the distance.</font>

1017
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,061
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">It has arrived.</font>

1018
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,735
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

1019
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:03,409
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

1020
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,090
<font color="#f1b178">My mind is a maelstrom and I See all.</font>

1021
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,948
<font color="#f1b178">In this moment, I pervade every sensation.</font>

1022
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:15,030
<font color="#f1b178">Be it the sensation of my body directing its dance,</font>

1023
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,704
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my arm bending and bleeding,</font>

1024
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,378
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my fingers weaving their song,</font>

1025
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:26,460
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of scorn for the beast before me.</font>

1026
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,726
<font color="#f1b178">At the apex of obsession, all is one.</font>

1027
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,767
<font color="#f1b178">This beast shall be slain.</font>

1028
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:36,040
<font color="#f1b178">Floors have shattered, the beast is pushing through.</font>

1029
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:40,122
<font color="#f1b178">There is not a single emotion upon its disgusting face.</font>

1030
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,571
<font color="#f1b178">Does there not linger Soeise's compassion,</font>

1031
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:45,020
<font color="#f1b178">or Roeroan's rage or Teonan's guilt,</font>

1032
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:48,286
<font color="#f1b178">or the beautiful reverence once harbored by Sal?</font>

1033
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,327
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">You are hating, father.</font>

1034
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,368
<font color="#f1b178">Speak, devil, speak!</font>

1035
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,409
<font color="#f1b178">I beg of you, speak!</font>

1036
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,865
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop, father, you are hurting, hurting!</font>

1037
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,906
<font color="#f1b178"><b>Speak to me, brother!</b></font>

1038
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,947
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop it right now!</font>

1039
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,805
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Retreat at once! Do it for us!</font>

1040
00:58:04,806 --> 00:58:06,846
<font color="#f1b178">I must... not...</font>

1041
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,887
<font color="#f1b178">Merely...</font>

1042
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,928
<font color="#f1b178">Oh Azachon... almighty...</font>

1043
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:12,969
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

1044
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,000
<font color="#f1b178">Ah... I have... failed.</font>

1045
00:58:21,002 --> 00:58:24,267
<font color="#467546">What was that bald guy going on about?</font>

1046
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,308
<font color="#467546">Me, a "beast"? A "devil"?</font>

1047
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:29,166
<font color="#467546">My memories contain nothing warranting such words.</font>

1048
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:32,432
<font color="#467546">...and these Memories aren't mine to begin with.</font>

1049
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:34,473
<font color="#467546">...Right?</font>

1050
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:37,331
<font color="#467546">He also muttered something about the Eye.</font>

1051
00:58:37,332 --> 00:58:40,597
<font color="#467546">I'm simply doing what It requests of me.</font>

1052
00:58:40,598 --> 00:58:43,863
<font color="#467546">Doesn't that mean we're on the same side?</font>

1053
00:58:43,864 --> 00:58:46,312
<font color="#467546">Then why attack me so fiercely?</font>

1054
00:58:48,231 --> 00:58:51,496
<font color="#467546">That fight really brought us down deep, huh.</font>

1055
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:55,578
<font color="#467546">I cannot even make out the ceiling at this point.</font>

1056
00:58:55,579 --> 00:58:58,027
<font color="#467546">Didn't think ruins could be ruined.</font>

1057
00:58:58,028 --> 00:59:02,109
<font color="#467546">I hope I can still find something under the rubble.</font>

1058
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:07,824
<font color="#467546">Although, this fight was more informative than any of the Eye's Memories so far.</font>

1059
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:11,090
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I should ask the Eye about this.</font>

1060
00:59:11,091 --> 00:59:13,948
<font color="#467546">...On second thought, perhaps I should not.</font>

1061
00:59:15,867 --> 00:59:19,948
<font color="#467546">I thought it was because of all the fighting, but...</font>

1062
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:21,989
<font color="#467546">It's <i>hot</i> down here.</font>

1063
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,663
<font color="#467546">So much hotter than the caverns and ruins above.</font>

1064
00:59:25,664 --> 00:59:28,521
<font color="#467546">Yet, somehow, I don't really <i>feel</i> it.</font>

1065
00:59:28,522 --> 00:59:32,603
<font color="#467546">It feels as if I'm changing the deeper I'm going.</font>

1066
00:59:32,604 --> 00:59:35,869
<font color="#467546">I don't need to sleep any more, either.</font>

1067
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,910
<font color="#467546">My appetite's also disappeared...</font>

1068
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:41,176
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">But I guess that's all a good thing.</font>

1069
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:46,074
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sleep and meals in a place like this are only a bother.</font>

1070
00:59:47,993 --> 00:59:50,033
<font color="#467546">This gate is humongous.</font>

1071
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:54,523
<font color="#467546">I really hope that whatever adventure awaits on the other side...</font>

1072
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:59,000
<font color="#467546">It will be kinder to me than my journey so far.</font>

1073
00:59:59,001 --> 00:59:59,100
<font color="#467546"></font>

1074
00:59:59,101 --> 00:59:59,200
<font color="#467546"></font>

1075
00:59:59,201 --> 00:59:59,300
<font color="#467546"></font>

1076
00:59:59,301 --> 00:59:59,400
<font color="#467546"></font>

1077
00:59:59,401 --> 00:59:59,500
<font color="#467546"></font>

1078
00:59:59,501 --> 00:59:59,600
<font color="#467546"></font>

1079
00:59:59,601 --> 00:59:59,700
<font color="#467546"></font>

1080
00:59:59,701 --> 00:59:59,800
<font color="#467546"></font>

1081
00:59:59,801 --> 00:59:59,900
<font color="#467546"></font>

1082
00:59:59,901 --> 00:59:59,999
