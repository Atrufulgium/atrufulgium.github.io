1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,290
<font color="#467546">...the eye.</font>

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,739
<font color="#467546">That was such a strange dream.</font>

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,780
<font color="#467546">...these towers.</font>

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,229
<font color="#467546">This is an even stranger dream.</font>

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,270
<font color="#467546">Woken up by these bells...</font>

6
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,719
<font color="#467546">Standing up from this soft bed...</font>

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,760
<font color="#467546">I take in my surroundings.</font>

8
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,801
<font color="#467546">I don't understand these towers.</font>

9
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:30,067
<font color="#467546">These towers are <i>floating</i>, high in the air.</font>

10
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,741
<font color="#467546">Yet they are so brittle. Crumbling all around me.</font>

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:39,456
<font color="#467546">The rocks I step on keep slipping away. Falling into the bottomless nothingness below.</font>

12
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,354
<font color="#467546">Only to be caught by a net of vines even further down.</font>

13
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,212
<font color="#467546">Yet I keep making progress... I think?</font>

14
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#467546">I don't know where I'm going, really.</font>

15
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,928
<font color="#467546">Around these towers are strange floating masses.</font>

16
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:57,826
<font color="#467546">Are these masses made of rock? Not any I have ever seen.</font>

17
00:00:57,827 --> 00:01:00,275
<font color="#467546">And those strange plants on top...</font>

18
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:02,316
<font color="#467546">Truly a strange dream.</font>

19
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:05,174
<font color="#467546">An eternal twilight <i>(or is it dawn?)</i>...</font>

20
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,215
<font color="#467546">...a sky covered in stars...</font>

21
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:10,073
<font color="#467546">...yet no sun or moon in sight.</font>

22
00:01:10,074 --> 00:01:12,114
<font color="#467546">What <i>is</i> this place?</font>

23
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:16,196
<font color="#467546">I decide to go back to where I woke up.</font>

24
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:19,054
<font color="#467546">Maybe there's something I missed, over there.</font>

25
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:25,256
<font color="#467546">But returning is already a bridge too far.</font>

26
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:28,930
<font color="#467546">That path has already crumbled when I wasn't watching.</font>

27
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:32,196
<font color="#467546">It's weird. I do not feel any distress.</font>

28
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:34,645
<font color="#467546">...or rather, <i>should</i> I feel distress?</font>

29
00:01:34,646 --> 00:01:40,360
<font color="#467546">This is all a dream after all. Can I go wherever I feel like?</font>

30
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:46,154
<font color="#467546"><i>Can</i> I go wherever I feel like?</font>

31
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:49,012
<font color="#467546">I see a bridge in the distance.</font>

32
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:52,278
<font color="#467546">It connects to one of those floating masses.</font>

33
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,544
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I can find something worthwhile over there.</font>

34
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:59,218
<font color="#467546">These towers are completely abandoned. There is nothing here.</font>

35
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,892
<font color="#467546">Not even wildlife. Not even food. Not even birds.</font>

36
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:06,974
<font color="#467546">Only the howling wind and the sound of shifting rocks.</font>

37
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#467546">I continue on.</font>

38
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,041
<font color="#467546">Finally, some more stable footing.</font>

39
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,490
<font color="#467546">These sickly yellow masses are curious.</font>

40
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:19,164
<font color="#467546">The material certainly <i>feels</i> like rock. Firm like rock.</font>

41
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:21,205
<font color="#467546">Nevertheless, it's covered in... stuff.</font>

42
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:24,063
<font color="#467546">Like layers and layers of unknowable fossils.</font>

43
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:28,145
<font color="#467546">Strange green coral <i>things</i> are growing where the light reaches.</font>

44
00:02:28,146 --> 00:02:31,819
<font color="#467546">Some plant-life is struggling to grow in the shade.</font>

45
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,493
<font color="#467546">But on top of these masses are beautiful flowers.</font>

46
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:37,534
<font color="#467546">Enormous flowers.</font>

47
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:39,983
<font color="#467546">What creature could even pollinate those?</font>

48
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:42,432
<font color="#467546">Do these plants even have stamen?</font>

49
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,290
<font color="#467546">Do these rocks simply produce these growths?</font>

50
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,331
<font color="#467546">Who knows.</font>

51
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,780
<font color="#467546">Dreams always pose the weirdest questions.</font>

52
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,821
<font color="#467546">Confused. Curious. Cautious.</font>

53
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:03,117
<font color="#467546">Moving further, the sights become even more interesting.</font>

54
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:07,607
<font color="#467546">Weirdly square pillars, made of this same rock, connecting these masses.</font>

55
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,648
<font color="#467546">Horizontal. Vertical. Grid-like. Everywhere.</font>

56
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,914
<font color="#467546">Edges covered in that very same green coral.</font>

57
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:15,363
<font color="#467546">Light is leaking in some places.</font>

58
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,629
<font color="#467546">Bioluminescence? Maybe something like lava? Hard to tell.</font>

59
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,119
<font color="#467546">Crossing one such natural artificial bridge, I could feel some heat.</font>

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,160
<font color="#467546">Are these pillars... alive?</font>

61
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:27,609
<font color="#467546">Dreams always pose the weirdest questions.</font>

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,129
<font color="#467546">This train of thought brought me back to the dream before.</font>

63
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,170
<font color="#467546">Just what was that eye?</font>

64
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:47,068
<font color="#467546">Wherever I looked, it appeared right in the middle of my vision.</font>

65
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,742
<font color="#467546">With my eyes wide open. With my eyes closed.</font>

66
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:53,999
<font color="#467546">I seem to recall it communicating with me.</font>

67
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:58,490
<font color="#467546">However, I fail to recall what it meant to tell me.</font>

68
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:02,164
<font color="#467546">I'm certain it had to do with this dream.</font>

69
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:05,022
<font color="#467546">Is it hostile? Is it a companion?</font>

70
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:08,696
<font color="#467546">It's pointless to mull over if I can't remember.</font>

71
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,227
<font color="#467546">I see a hole in the wall.</font>

72
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:19,717
<font color="#467546">It does not seem natural. Well, what in this dream does?</font>

73
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,758
<font color="#467546">I climb inside.</font>

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,616
<font color="#467546">The first thing to note: it's hot.</font>

75
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,290
<font color="#467546">These walls are definitely secreting some sort of lava.</font>

76
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:34,005
<font color="#467546">There is a small puddle in the corner. Best not to get too close.</font>

77
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:37,679
<font color="#467546">The second thing to note: this is a room.</font>

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
<font color="#467546">An actual, proper, room.</font>

79
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,761
<font color="#467546">Bookshelves are stacked neatly.</font>

80
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:45,027
<font color="#467546">There are some workman's tools near the puddle.</font>

81
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:50,334
<font color="#467546">I attempt to grab a book. The heat has seared all covers together.</font>

82
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,783
<font color="#467546">The pages, too, have melded together.</font>

83
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:57,273
<font color="#467546">Next to the puddle, there is a hallway going deeper inside.</font>

84
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:05,028
<font color="#467546">I want to believe these corridors and rooms are man-made.</font>

85
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,886
<font color="#467546">But these passages are like a maze.</font>

86
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,152
<font color="#467546">There are too many nonsensical corners and ends.</font>

87
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:14,418
<font color="#467546">No human would ever build something like this.</font>

88
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,132
<font color="#467546">Did these rooms... <i>grow</i>?</font>

89
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,990
<font color="#467546">These halls are giving me the creeps.</font>

90
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,256
<font color="#467546">Let's head back to someplace less swelteringly hot.</font>

91
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,970
<font color="#467546">Ah, the outside wind.</font>

92
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:34,000
<font color="#467546">Refreshing.</font>

93
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,674
<font color="#467546">I don't know for how long I've been wandering.</font>

94
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,532
<font color="#467546">There is no telling the time here.</font>

95
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,798
<font color="#467546">No sun, no moon, only an eternal twilight.</font>

96
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,656
<font color="#467546">Where does the light even come from?</font>

97
00:05:50,657 --> 00:05:55,554
<font color="#467546">I only have my appetite as a way to tell the time.</font>

98
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,820
<font color="#467546">Will this dream ever come to an end?</font>

99
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,330
<font color="#467546"><i>Is this even a dream?</i></font>

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
<font color="#467546"><i>No, no-no-no, no.</i></font>

101
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:11,514
<font color="#467546">That's a bad thought. Let's continue exploring for now.</font>

102
00:06:11,515 --> 00:06:16,004
<font color="#467546">Looking around this strange place has actually become kind of fun.</font>

103
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:18,045
<font color="#467546">I can't explain it.</font>

104
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:21,311
<font color="#467546">There are some majestic structures in the distance.</font>

105
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:24,169
<font color="#467546">They look like some sort of temple.</font>

106
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,496
<font color="#467546">This must be a place of worship.</font>

107
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:32,762
<font color="#467546">These halls are elaborate, and full of relics.</font>

108
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:35,211
<font color="#467546">Nothing like those unnerving hallways earlier.</font>

109
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:40,109
<font color="#467546">On the other side, there is a floating path leading straight forward.</font>

110
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,375
<font color="#467546">At the end lies some sort of monument.</font>

111
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,416
<font color="#467546">Standing there, a <i>person!</i></font>

112
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,457
<font color="#467546">And beyond that monument...</font>

113
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:53,192
<font color="#467546">A massive Eye is watching over this place.</font>

114
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:56,458
<font color="#467546">Is "Eye" even the correct word for this?</font>

115
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,316
<font color="#467546">The shapes are definitely "eyelid", "iris", "pupil".</font>

116
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:04,623
<font color="#467546">But they are just shapes, floating there, creating the impression of an eye.</font>

117
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,664
<font color="#467546">And so many more shapes.</font>

118
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,705
<font color="#467546">Is this Eye...</font>

119
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:10,746
<font color="#467546">...the one from that dream?</font>

120
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="#467546">I open my mouth for the first time:</font>

121
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,342
<font color="#467546">Who are you? Is that <i>thing</i>-</font>

126
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:31,003
<font color="#467546">...I'm sorry, ma'am.</font>

127
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:34,516
<font color="#467546">But could you please explain this dream to me?</font>

128
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:36,468
<font color="#467546">I'm absolutely lost.</font>

129

<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">"Dream" Is Not A Suitable Descriptor For What You See.</font>

00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,207
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Give It And Its Fifteen Siblings To Us.</font>

140
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,159
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">We Will Refresh Your Memory.</font>

141
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,062
<font color="#467546">Did you mean this? I guess I don't need it.</font>

142
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Excellent. Well Then...</font>

143
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,674
<font color="#467546">So this is that "King" the Eye talked about.</font>

144
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,715
<font color="#467546">...</font>

145
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:33,205
<font color="#467546">I have made my way across chunks much smaller than before.</font>

146
00:08:33,206 --> 00:08:39,328
<font color="#467546">Their surface has been eroded by the wind, covered in a thin layer of sand.</font>

147
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:43,818
<font color="#467546">Despite the sand, there's a surprising amount of plants growing here.</font>

148
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:46,267
<font color="#467546">They grow as tall as buildings.</font>

149
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:49,941
<font color="#467546">Does that over-the-top size help with heat regulation? Photosynthesis?</font>

150
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:52,799
<font color="#467546">Between these plants lies a ruined town.</font>

151
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,881
<font color="#467546">The centerpiece, a large... pyramid with a statue on top.</font>

152
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:58,922
<font color="#467546">Surprisingly intact.</font>

153
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:00,963
<font color="#467546">So this is that "King".</font>

154
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:05,453
<font color="#467546">Cannot say I'd be thrilled to live here, under his rule.</font>

155
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:08,311
<font color="#467546">Given everyone's either gone or dead already.</font>

156
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,464
<font color="#467546">There's still quite some stuff to scavenge here.</font>

157
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:21,730
<font color="#467546">It's pretty surprising these fruits haven't spoiled yet.</font>

158
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,771
<font color="#467546">...</font>

159
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:28,261
<font color="#467546">If this is not a dream, like the Eye told me...</font>

160
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:31,935
<font color="#467546">...then why does nothing make sense in this place?</font>

161
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:36,425
<font color="#467546">Certainly, this breeze feels warm and dry, and very much life-like.</font>

162
00:09:36,426 --> 00:09:39,283
<font color="#467546">But we've all had realistic dreams before.</font>

163
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:42,141
<font color="#467546">And dreams within dreams, for that matter.</font>

164
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:44,999
<font color="#467546">I'll judge what reality is to me.</font>

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,040
<font color="#467546"><i>And this isn't it</i>.</font>

166
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,968
<font color="#467546">Let's explore that pyramid.</font>

167
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,000
<font color="#467546">I'm curious about that statue.</font>

168
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,898
<font color="#467546">From nearby, it's less of a "pyramid", and more of a "tower".</font>

169
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,388
<font color="#467546">The inside is also much more spacious than I would've expected.</font>

170
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,654
<font color="#467546">There is this huge pillar in the center.</font>

171
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,961
<font color="#467546">It's made of the same sickly yellow rock as the masses all around.</font>

172
00:10:19,962 --> 00:10:22,410
<font color="#467546">The green coral and lava, too.</font>

173
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:26,900
<font color="#467546">But there is also some curious liquid dripping from the top.</font>

174
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:30,166
<font color="#467546">A faintly glowing liquid, somewhat crimson or purple-colored.</font>

175
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,840
<font color="#467546">Leaking from the ceiling far above down deep below.</font>

176
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,881
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>...</font>

177
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,922
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

178
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,963
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

179
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:44,861
<font color="#467546">For the first time in this dream, an acute feeling of dread.</font>

180
00:10:44,862 --> 00:10:47,310
<font color="#467546">I dare not touch that liquid.</font>

181
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,168
<font color="#467546">The liquid falling into the depths below...</font>

182
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:53,026
<font color="#467546">Huh, below this "pyramid" is another structure.</font>

183
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:57,108
<font color="#467546">Strange symmetrical pathways, suspended in midair, below this floating island.</font>

184
00:10:57,109 --> 00:10:59,149
<font color="#467546">Rotating. Very, very slowly.</font>

185
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,415
<font color="#467546">Much quicker is the sandstorm engulfing those paths.</font>

186
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,681
<font color="#467546">I need to go to the bottom-most layer.</font>

187
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:08,130
<font color="#467546">Why? I couldn't even tell you.</font>

188
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:10,171
<font color="#467546">Just a hunch.</font>

189
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:15,478
<font color="#467546">I carefully make my way down from my safe haven inside the pyramid.</font>

190
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:19,560
<font color="#467546">However, I can't continue like this. I need to jump.</font>

191
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,826
<font color="#467546">It's only a few meters, but still stressful.</font>

192
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:26,500
<font color="#467546">...I thought I couldn't get scared in this dream?</font>

193
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,541
<font color="#467546">I jump..</font>

194
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,582
<font color="#467546">...</font>

195
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,623
<font color="#467546">..and land.</font>

196
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,664
<font color="#467546">However, this sandstorm is intense...</font>

197
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:36,705
<font color="#467546">I tumble near the edge.</font>

198
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,746
<font color="#467546">I tumble off the edge.</font>

199
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:40,787
<font color="#467546">Freefalling.</font>

200
00:11:40,788 --> 00:11:42,828
<font color="#467546">Fainting.</font>

201
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,041
<font color="#f1b178">At last, the surface...</font>

202
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,490
<font color="#f1b178">To have finally reached up here...</font>

203
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:56,980
<font color="#f1b178">This place is always so much more perilous than it seems.</font>

204
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,429
<font color="#f1b178">What dangers will this grove hold?</font>

205
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,470
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You did well, child.</font>

206
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,328
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Your journey is almost at its end.</font>

207
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,186
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Do not falter in its final steps.</font>

208
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:12,084
<font color="#f1b178">I only did well because I didn't run into <i>them</i> this time.</font>

209
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:15,350
<font color="#f1b178">It was nothing but a stroke of luck.</font>

210
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Child, do not concern yourself with such trivialities.</font>

211
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,657
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">We are now up here.</font>

212
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:24,739
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You ought to feel a sense of pride for this.</font>

213
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,780
<font color="#f1b178">You are right, my lady.</font>

214
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,229
<font color="#f1b178">Soon, I will finally reach Harmony.</font>

215
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,004
<font color="#f1b178">Venerable lady, I must confess.</font>

216
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,045
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Speak your heart, child.</font>

217
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,086
<font color="#f1b178">The stream stirs so silently...</font>

218
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,535
<font color="#f1b178">The springs bubble with such delight...</font>

219
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:51,617
<font color="#f1b178">The stars wax and wane... the sky waves and wanders...</font>

220
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:54,475
<font color="#f1b178">I see such beauty in this land.</font>

221
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,516
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Does that surprise you?</font>

222
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:00,598
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Did you not expect beauty, here in the cosmic midst?</font>

223
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,639
<font color="#f1b178">I don't know.</font>

224
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,721
<font color="#f1b178">It's just... the things they tell back home, they're different.</font>

225
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,762
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Nonetheless, they are true.</font>

226
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,620
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Beauty to one is horror to another.</font>

227
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,478
<font color="#f1b178">Then what does that say about me?</font>

228
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,744
<font color="#f1b178">One who finds such beauty in the defiled?</font>

229
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:22,642
<font color="#f1b178">I'm aware of its evils, and the taint that stains its sky...</font>

230
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:25,500
<font color="#f1b178">But I'm still inclined to love, somehow.</font>

231
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,949
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">It's all a matter of perception.</font>

232
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,215
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Only a right view may penetrate this illusion.</font>

233
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,664
<font color="#f1b178">Then do I simply lack wisdom?</font>

234
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:36,522
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh, dear, I'd never accuse you thereof!</font>

235
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,971
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">But indeed, you do lack wisdom.</font>

00:25:51,173 --> 00:25:53,213
<font color="#954444">Second, and beneath, Purification.</font>

411
00:25:53,214 --> 00:25:55,254
<font color="#954444">The Province in Darkness;</font>

412
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:59,744
<font color="#954444">Where pain and pleasure both shall cleanse the soul of sin.</font>

413
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:02,193
<font color="#954444">Third, and beyond the gates, Awakening.</font>

414
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,234
<font color="#954444">The Province in Flames;</font>

415
00:26:04,235 --> 00:26:08,724
<font color="#954444">Where the light of inferno shall show the mind its truth.</font>

416
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,765
<font color="#954444">Fourth, and deep below, Hierogamy.</font>

417
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,806
<font color="#954444">The Province in Starlight;</font>

418
00:26:12,807 --> 00:26:16,888
<font color="#954444">Where the essences coalesce, and the triad shall become one.</font>

419
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,499
<font color="#954444">Sun and Moon have collided, their sacred milk fills the bath.</font>

420
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,948
<font color="#954444">Beware, and adhere to the acts.</font>

421
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:33,622
<font color="#954444">Act 1: Thou shalt not bathe in the quintessence.</font>

422
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:42,194
<font color="#954444">Act 2: Thou shalt not interfere with, travel to, or otherwise communicate with those on the other side of the quintessence.</font>

423
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:47,092
<font color="#954444">Act 3: Thou shalt not show thy bare face to the quintessence.</font>

424
00:26:47,093 --> 00:26:50,766
<font color="#954444">Act 4: Thou shalt not speak to the quintessence.</font>

425
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:54,440
<font color="#954444">Act 5: Thou shalt not listen to the quintessence.</font>

426
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:58,930
<font color="#954444">Act 6: Thou shalt not lay thine eyes upon the quintessence.</font>

427
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:05,869
<font color="#954444">Act 7: Thou shalt not tell any heretics or uninitiated individuals about the whereabouts of the quintessence.</font>

428
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,276
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no hatred,</font>

429
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:18,317
<font color="#954444">For we shall be love.</font>

430
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:21,583
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no death,</font>

431
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,624
<font color="#954444">For we shall be life.</font>

432
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,890
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no emptiness,</font>

433
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:29,339
<font color="#954444">For we shall be the cosmos.</font>

434
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,605
<font color="#954444">In the Eternal Kingdom, there is no loneliness,</font>

435
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:36,279
<font color="#954444">For we all shall be one and the same.</font>

436
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,545
<font color="#954444">Oh Quintessence, open our eyes to this truth.</font>

437
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,449
<font color="#467546">...time to break this huge window.</font>

438
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,898
<font color="#467546">I can't stand this "quintessence" stuff.</font>

439
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:52,164
<font color="#467546">I give the glass a good three whacks.</font>

440
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:54,205
<font color="#467546">And then it shatters.</font>

441
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:58,287
<font color="#467546">The liquid doesn't even spill, it just floats in place.</font>

442
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:03,594
<font color="#467546">I climb through the hole in the window, into unexpectedly warm subterranean air.</font>

443
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:07,676
<font color="#467546">All my senses are under constant attack in this cavern.</font>

444
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:09,717
<font color="#467546">Most unexpectedly, hearing.</font>

445
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:14,207
<font color="#467546">What causes these large reverberations? What is all of this noise?</font>

446
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,656
<font color="#467546">Do those glowing plants cause it?</font>

447
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:19,922
<font color="#467546">Are they also responsible for this rotten smell?</font>

448
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,083
<font color="#467546">In the middle of this cavern is this huge pillar.</font>

449
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:31,349
<font color="#467546">Near the top it splits up into four.</font>

450
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,615
<font color="#467546">Where each branch, again, splits up into four.</font>

451
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:36,656
<font color="#467546">Repeating, seemingly infinitely.</font>

452
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:41,963
<font color="#467546">Like that cathedral just now, it's made of the same sickly yellow rock.</font>

453
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:45,229
<font color="#467546">I'm all too familiar with it by now.</font>

454
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,270
<font color="#467546">With the same green growths.</font>

455
00:28:47,271 --> 00:28:50,128
<font color="#467546">The exposed lava looks somewhat like writing.</font>

456
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,577
<font color="#467546">Of course, I cannot read it.</font>

457
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:57,884
<font color="#467546">Looking at the bottom of the cavern, the pillar comes from a lake.</font>

458
00:28:57,885 --> 00:29:01,558
<font color="#467546">And further below, it burrows deep into the ground.</font>

459
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,456
<font color="#467546">The lake seems to contain the same liquid as everything else here.</font>

460
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:10,946
<font color="#467546">Looking from this high up, the purple crimson seems to twinkle.</font>

461
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:12,987
<font color="#467546">Twinkling like the stars outside.</font>

462
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:15,028
<font color="#467546">It almost looks inviting.</font>

463
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:17,069
<font color="#467546">But I will not.</font>

464
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:20,743
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look around the rest of the cave.</font>

465
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:24,009
<font color="#467546">There are four bridges going into the pillar.</font>

466
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,050
<font color="#467546">One for each cardinal direction.</font>

467
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:31,765
<font color="#467546">The center seems like as good a place as any to set up camp.</font>

468
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,000
<font color="#467546">This place is pleasing to the senses.</font>

469
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

470
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:48,715
<font color="#954444">I begged her to never open her eyes again.</font>

471
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:53,205
<font color="#954444">Whatever she dreams of is not fit for one so innocent.</font>

472
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,246
<font color="#954444">Her expressions when sleeping...</font>

473
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,287
<font color="#954444">Her demeanor when awake...</font>

474
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,961
<font color="#954444">I pray to you, let those dreams be dreams.</font>

475
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,002
<font color="#954444">No one deserves such dreams.</font>

476
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:08,717
<font color="#954444">While my daughter has yet the ability to smile, allow her to do so.</font>

477
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:11,575
<font color="#954444">I beg of you, Queen of Starlight...</font>

478
00:30:15,973 --> 00:30:20,870
<font color="#954444">When I first found her, I saw faint starlight in her eyes.</font>

479
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,136
<font color="#954444">I knew for certain she was the one.</font>

480
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:26,994
<font color="#954444">Initially, I chose her for her talent,</font>

481
00:30:26,995 --> 00:30:32,301
<font color="#954444">But now I can only see someone I have to protect from themselves.</font>

482
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:36,383
<font color="#954444">I can only muster so much dedication in a lifetime.</font>

483
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:40,873
<font color="#954444">A single pupil is enough to last me until my death.</font>

484
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:46,588
<font color="#954444">I hope that she understands that, even if not by blood, she's my child.</font>

485
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:49,037
<font color="#954444">And I love her for it.</font>

486
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:57,516
<font color="#954444">And now, the time has come for me to choose.</font>

487
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,557
<font color="#954444">Will I protect my daughter?</font>

488
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,823
<font color="#954444">Or will I stay true to my creed?</font>

489
00:31:02,824 --> 00:31:04,864
<font color="#954444">I have always been loyal.</font>

490
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:08,946
<font color="#954444">I did not think such a dilemma would ever arise.</font>

491
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,212
<font color="#954444">So I beg of you, Queen of Starlight.</font>

492
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:14,253
<font color="#954444">Whatever my choice may be.</font>

493
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,519
<font color="#954444">Whether I become a sinner or a saint.</font>

494
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,968
<font color="#954444">Please accept my decision with grace.</font>

495
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, ███████</font>

496
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

497
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,715
<font color="#954444">I've lied to her ever since I knew her.</font>

498
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:34,573
<font color="#954444">Yet it was all for her sake.</font>

499
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:39,471
<font color="#954444">And for as long as she didn't notice, she was indeed happy.</font>

500
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:44,369
<font color="#954444">For thirteen years, she was the happiest girl I had ever seen.</font>

501
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,818
<font color="#954444">I couldn't have asked for more.</font>

502
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:51,001
<font color="#954444">However,</font>

503
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:55,083
<font color="#954444">As her mental condition deteriorated, the lies failed to uphold.</font>

504
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:57,532
<font color="#954444">Lately, she acted out in rage.</font>

505
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:01,614
<font color="#954444">I had to confine her before it was too late.</font>

506
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,063
<font color="#954444">Rather understandably, she hates me now.</font>

507
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:06,104
<font color="#954444">...</font>

508
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:09,370
<font color="#954444">My own daughter earnestly wishes for my disappearance.</font>

509
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:15,085
<font color="#954444">If it continues like this, it won't be long before the world will notice.</font>

510
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,351
<font color="#954444">I committed acts not worthy of your ears.</font>

511
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:24,474
<font color="#954444">The starlight in her eyes kept on growing, and so I became overwhelmed with distress.</font>

512
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,923
<font color="#954444">They had to be shut forever.</font>

513
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:28,964
<font color="#954444">...</font>

514
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,147
<font color="#954444">...</font>

515
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:36,005
<font color="#954444">But even half-blind, she managed to escape.</font>

516
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:38,863
<font color="#954444">I reckon this verdict pleases you greatly.</font>

517
00:32:38,864 --> 00:32:42,129
<font color="#954444">It <i>is</i> your very own birth, after all.</font>

518
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,027
<font color="#954444">As for me, I don't think I can continue on any longer.</font>

519
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:49,476
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I love;</font>

520
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:51,925
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I worship;</font>

521
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:54,374
<font color="#954444">In doing so, I've betrayed myself.</font>

522
00:32:54,375 --> 00:33:00,905
<font color="#954444">I'll just let her be from now on. Perhaps she will find happiness on her own.</font>

523
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:02,946
<font color="#954444">So.</font>

524
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,987
<font color="#954444">Queen of Starlight, my daughter.</font>

525
00:33:04,988 --> 00:33:07,028
<font color="#954444">Like this we will part.</font>

526
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:11,110
<font color="#954444">I pray for you to one day reach the end,</font>

527
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:13,968
<font color="#954444">Just as I will soon reach mine.</font>

528
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:16,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, ███████</font>

529
00:33:20,001 --> 00:35:28,000
<font color="FF00FF">The Comprehensive Abyss has no story yet. Skip to 35:28.</font>

530
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,041
<font color="#954444">Quintessence.</font>

531
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:37,307
<font color="#954444">If only we could understand Its true potential.</font>

532
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:39,348
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Remember your Master's Master?</font>

533
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,389
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">She advanced our understanding greatly.</font>

534
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,063
<font color="#954444">We have certainly been able to increase Its purity.</font>

535
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:49,553
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Is your task then not the same? Follow in her footsteps.</font>

536
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:53,227
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Give us an even better view of the Starlight.</font>

537
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:56,901
<font color="#954444">You only want that for your own, selfish purposes.</font>

538
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:58,942
<font color="#954444">Am I not right?</font>

539
00:35:58,943 --> 00:36:00,983
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">...</font>

540
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,993
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">How have you been? It has been a while.</font>

541
00:36:06,994 --> 00:36:09,034
<font color="#954444">Oh, it is only you.</font>

542
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,892
<font color="#954444">Have your rotten eyes finally failed you?</font>

543
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:14,750
<font color="#954444">I am busy. Do not disturb me.</font>

544
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:16,791
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Cold as ever.</font>

545
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,240
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You ignored the last Sabbath's call.</font>

546
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:21,281
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Are you truly that busy?</font>

547
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:24,139
<font color="#954444">Did your Master not raise you properly?</font>

548
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,180
<font color="#954444">"Devote oneself to the Starlight."</font>

549
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:29,038
<font color="#954444">You are a disgrace to our discipline.</font>

550
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,712
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">But <i>you</i> are the one who skipped <i>the Sabbath</i>.</font>

551
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:34,753
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">No research can justify that.</font>

552
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:36,794
<font color="#954444">I can taste the Starlight.</font>

553
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,171
<font color="#954444">This liquid is truly marvelous.</font>

554
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:43,620
<font color="#954444">I can see the stars twinkle.</font>

555
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:45,661
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Your condition has worsened again.</font>

556
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:50,968
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You really are on the right path. It seems you drew their ire.</font>

557
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:54,234
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">I heard they took over the other day?</font>

558
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:56,275
<font color="#954444">Ah yes...</font>

559
00:36:56,276 --> 00:37:00,357
<font color="#954444">The voices managed to break a few bones. Nothing more.</font>

560
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,031
<font color="#954444">Barely significant compared to those growths on my leg.</font>

561
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:06,480
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Have you tried watering them yet?</font>

562
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,521
<font color="#954444">Very funny.</font>

563
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:10,562
<font color="#954444">...Actually...</font>

564
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,572
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You are not supposed to cover yourself with Quintessence.</font>

565
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:19,021
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">This has long been conventional wisdom.</font>

566
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:22,287
<font color="#954444">My mind is falling apart, I <i>need</i> this.</font>

567
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:25,553
<font color="#954444">I see glimpses of Starlight in my peripheral!</font>

568
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:28,411
<font color="#954444">Like my Master's Master! I <i>need</i> this!</font>

569
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,269
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">It is an inevitability of our research.</font>

570
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:36,167
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">But it is always so sad to see a dear friend go.</font>

571
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:39,433
<font color="#954444">I will not let the Angels stop me.</font>

572
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:45,148
<font color="#954444">I am <i>so</i> close to reaching The Inner. <b>Lend me a hand.</b></font>

573
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:49,525
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Truly unfortunate.</font>

574
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:51,974
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Only a pile of mush remains.</font>

575
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:54,015
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">His study, inaccessible. "Spores".</font>

576
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:57,281
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">He did not even leave a disciple behind.</font>

577
00:37:57,282 --> 00:38:00,547
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">I must thank my Master for his wisdom.</font>

578
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:04,221
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">"Do not lose sight of yourself when researching It."</font>

579
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:07,895
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">"They, and then you yourself, will turn you mad."</font>

580
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:11,977
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">As long as we are careful, we can avoid <i>this</i>.</font>

581
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">My voices are only faint.</font>

582
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,041
<font color="#467546">What a view.</font>

583
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,747
<font color="#467546">So apparently, the world ends.</font>

584
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:28,788
<font color="#467546">Quite quickly, in fact.</font>

585
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:31,646
<font color="#467546">Here I am, sitting on the ledge.</font>

586
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,687
<font color="#467546">Gazing into an eternal void.</font>

587
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:36,953
<font color="#467546">Nothing but the purple twilight that's become nostalgic.</font>

588
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:39,811
<font color="#467546">And the stars... They're so very pretty.</font>

589
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:43,077
<font color="#467546">How they pulse, oscillate, fade in, fade out.</font>

590
00:38:43,078 --> 00:38:45,118
<font color="#467546">Clearly they're not actually stars.</font>

591
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,384
<font color="#467546">But who even cares about details like that?</font>

592
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,090
<font color="#467546">What was it like, before?</font>

593
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:58,764
<font color="#467546">What kind of night sky was I used to?</font>

594
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:02,030
<font color="#467546">Before I woke up in those floating towers?</font>

595
00:39:02,031 --> 00:39:04,071
<font color="#467546">I can barely remember anymore.</font>

596
00:39:04,072 --> 00:39:06,520
<font color="#467546">It was certainly not this pretty.</font>

597
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,969
<font color="#467546">I've been slowly satiating the Eye.</font>

598
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,051
<font color="#467546">In return, It blesses me with memories that aren't mine.</font>

599
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:15,500
<font color="#467546">Things are gradually falling into place.</font>

600
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:19,990
<font color="#467546">Things are starting to make sense in their own, twisted way.</font>

601
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,848
<font color="#467546">But this place still doesn't feel real.</font>

602
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,889
<font color="#467546">Is anything real?</font>

603
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,930
<font color="#467546">Was anything real before?</font>

604
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:34,861
<font color="#467546">What did they call it again back home...</font>

605
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:36,902
<font color="#467546">The "call of the void"?</font>

606
00:39:36,903 --> 00:39:38,943
<font color="#467546">That primal urge to just...</font>

607
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:42,209
<font color="#467546">Jump off this ledge, into the abyss below.</font>

608
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,658
<font color="#467546">There is no "bottom" below this.</font>

609
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:46,699
<font color="#467546">Everything just becomes hazy.</font>

610
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,740
<font color="#467546">Everything just loses definition.</font>

611
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:52,414
<font color="#467546">The morbid curiosity, wanting to know what's down there.</font>

612
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,455
<font color="#467546">Or what <i>isn't</i> down there.</font>

613
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:02,794
<font color="#467546">Pretty weird, how even though it's an empty void...</font>

614
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:05,652
<font color="#467546">A lukewarm breeze flows through my hair.</font>

615
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,693
<font color="#467546">Where does it come from?</font>

616
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:09,734
<font color="#467546">...</font>

617
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:14,224
<font color="#467546">Nothing here makes sense, and <i>that</i> is what I'm concerned about?</font>

618
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,490
<font color="#467546">Heh, my mind really is in two places.</font>

619
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:19,939
<font color="#467546">The part that longs for home.</font>

620
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,388
<font color="#467546">The part that longs for here.</font>

621
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:25,246
<font color="#467546">Well, I can't go home either way.</font>

622
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:30,144
<font color="#467546">And this place is starting to feel a little like home too.</font>

623
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:32,185
<font color="#467546">Even with all the dangers.</font>

624
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,891
<font color="#467546">Enough monologuing.</font>

625
00:40:38,892 --> 00:40:42,973
<font color="#467546">No one here to listen to me babble on anyways.</font>

626
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#467546">Time to start moving again.</font>

627
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,490
<font color="#467546">Yuck, the quintessence in these caves is so much more potent.</font>

628
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:55,531
<font class="speaker2" color="#954444">██y ███████ you r██████red ███...</font>

629
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:59,205

630
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,246
<font color="#467546">It's creepy.</font>

631
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:05,328
<font color="#467546">I guess I should consider myself lucky I can't understand.</font>

634
00:41:10,737 --> 00:41:14,818
<font color="#467546">Why did these guys seem so obsessed with the stuff?</font>

635
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,267
<font color="#467546">It seems almost sacred to them.</font>

636
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:19,716
<font color="#467546">From what I could understand, anyway.</font>

637
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:23,390
<font color="#467546">Half the books I find are decayed beyond belief.</font>

638
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:27,064
<font color="#467546">And most writing is in this weird language anyway.</font>

00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,842

652
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,680

655
00:42:08,804 --> 00:42:11,252

661
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:30,539
<font color="#467546">Especially in the dark, it's like a night sky.</font>

662
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,213
<font color="#467546">A night sky I can't see on the outside.</font>

668
00:42:52,042 --> 00:42:54,490
<font color="#467546">That swamp was already bad enough,</font>

669
00:42:54,491 --> 00:42:57,348
<font color="#467546">but here it's covering the entire cavern!</font>

683
00:43:44,342 --> 00:43:49,239
<font color="#467546">I can't help but worry when looking at the mushrooms around me.</font>

684
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,913
<font color="#467546">Reminds me of those human-shaped fungi in the swamp.</font>

685

<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Do Not Worry.</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Do Not Name The Forbidden Liquid.</font>

693
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:18,682

698
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:32,561
<font color="#467546">No?</font>

699
00:44:32,562 --> 00:44:35,419
<font color="#467546">Anyway, what is that "vessel" thing inside?</font>

700
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,501
<font color="#467546">I can only see a silhouette through that membrane, but...</font>

701
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:41,542
<font color="#467546">it looks awfully non-human.</font>

702
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:44,808
<font color="#467546">And about as gross as everything else here.</font>

707
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:01,041
<font color="#428686">Look, dear child of mine.</font>

708
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,899
<font color="#428686">How beautiful she's grown up to be!</font>

709
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,940
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">What... what has she become?</font>

710
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:08,798
<font color="#428686">She has become whole, has she not?</font>

711
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:11,247
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">So was this meant to be?</font>

712
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:15,737
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">So the skin of marble, and the cracks upon her face,</font>

713
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:20,227
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">So the eyes of ink, and the blood upon her wings,</font>

714
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:22,268
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">It was meant to be?</font>

715
00:45:30,473 --> 00:45:33,330
<font color="#428686">All that ceases is destined to return.</font>

716
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,371
<font color="#428686">Witness, dear child of mine:</font>

717
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:37,412
<font color="#428686">Rebirth. The Law of Heaven!</font>

718
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,453
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I see...</font>

719
00:45:39,454 --> 00:45:41,902
<font color="#428686">Do not fret, do not fret.</font>

720
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:43,943
<font color="#428686">'Tis what makes us immortal.</font>

721
00:45:52,148 --> 00:45:55,001
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But my daughter, is she still there?</font>

722
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,859
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">What did you do to my daughter?!</font>

723
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,900
<font color="#428686">Breathe in, child.</font>

724
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,349
<font color="#428686">See there, her heart of marble.</font>

725
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,390
<font color="#428686">She still loves you, child.</font>

726
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:06,839
<font color="#428686">And with love, she shall conquer.</font>

727
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,288
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But is she not the Princess?</font>

728
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:12,146
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Whose sword sheds the blood of nations,</font>

729
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:15,004
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Whose voice judges the fate of kings,</font>

730
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,045
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Is she not ages-old?</font>

731
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:19,086
<font color="#428686">Indeed, she is!</font>

732
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:22,760
<font color="#428686">But you yourself, before your birth, were you naught?</font>

733
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:24,801
<font color="#428686">Are you not ages-old, too?</font>

734
00:46:24,802 --> 00:46:26,842
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I might be...</font>

735
00:46:26,843 --> 00:46:28,883
<font color="#428686">And have you not killed?</font>

736
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:30,924
<font color="#428686">And have you not judged?</font>

737
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:40,392
<font color="#428686">Do away with your illusions, child.</font>

738
00:46:40,393 --> 00:46:44,474
<font color="#428686">To love her rightly is to love all of her.</font>

739
00:46:44,475 --> 00:46:47,332
<font color="#428686">Whether girl or princess, innocent or cruel.</font>

740
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,373
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">I understand, venerable lady.</font>

741
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,822
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But I still need some time.</font>

742
00:46:51,823 --> 00:46:53,863
<font color="#428686">Do as you will.</font>

743
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:56,721
<font color="#428686">Harmony is within you, stand and gaze!</font>

744
00:46:56,722 --> 00:46:59,987
<font color="#428686">Gaze at what the Heavens have gifted you!</font>

745
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,041
<font color="#467546">Screw these caves.</font>

746
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,899
<font color="#467546">They are large, hot, labyrinthine, and worse,</font>

747
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,757
<font color="#467546"><i>so</i> much more dangerous than those wetlands.</font>

748
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:22,431
<font color="#467546">I've only collected what, like eight Memories so far?</font>

749
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:26,105
<font color="#467546">If only this place was a bit more generous...</font>

750
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:28,963
<font color="#467546">I would've long completed this stupid task.</font>

751
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:34,270
<font color="#467546">But I've agreed to it, so for the Eye's sake, I will continue.</font>

752
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,128
<font color="#467546">There's not much else to do, anyway.</font>

753
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:39,169
<font color="#467546">...</font>

754
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:44,067
<font color="#467546">I feel like I've found every landmark these caves have to offer.</font>

755
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:48,149
<font color="#467546">There's that river, that cathedral, that <i>thing</i> in the center...</font>

756
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,231
<font color="#467546">...that fungus place, that palace that gives me the creeps...</font>

757
00:47:52,232 --> 00:47:54,272
<font color="#467546">None lead me down further.</font>

758
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:58,762
<font color="#467546">Surely I don't have to <i>dig</i> my way down, do I?</font>

759
00:48:01,286 --> 00:48:03,326
<font color="#467546">I've finally found something...</font>

760
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,184
<font color="#467546">I've been wandering these caves for ages,</font>

761
00:48:06,185 --> 00:48:08,633
<font color="#467546">looking at every nook and cranny...</font>

762
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:10,674
<font color="#467546">Why <i>here</i>, of all places!</font>

763
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:13,532
<font color="#467546">Ah well, finally something to <i>do</i> again.</font>

764
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:17,614
<font color="#467546">I break my way through the bars into these ruins.</font>

765
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,655
<font color="#467546">I step inside...</font>

766
00:48:19,656 --> 00:48:23,737
<font color="#467546">...and the second my foot touches the floor, it collapses.</font>

767
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,778
<font color="#467546">Great, one of those places.</font>

768
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:31,567
<font color="#467546">Who put all these traps in these ruins!</font>

769
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,608
<font color="#467546">It makes no sense.</font>

770
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:38,915
<font color="#467546">This place looks like it's designed to do one, and only one thing:</font>

771
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,956
<font color="#467546">To kill. Specifically, me.</font>

772
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:44,630
<font color="#467546">Moreso than any other place so far, at least.</font>

773
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:48,304
<font color="#467546">Usually the beasts and monsters are the dangerous part...</font>

774
00:48:48,305 --> 00:48:51,978
<font color="#467546">But here, the floor collapses nearly all the time,</font>

775
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:55,652
<font color="#467546">arrows appear out of nowhere aimed straight at me,</font>

776
00:48:55,653 --> 00:48:59,326
<font color="#467546">I've even had the ceiling collapse on me once!</font>

777
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:02,184
<font color="#467546">The heat here is also something else.</font>

778
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:06,266
<font color="#467546">It makes focusing on my surroundings so much more difficult.</font>

779
00:49:06,267 --> 00:49:09,532
<font color="#467546">To think I found those caves too dangerous.</font>

780
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:12,390
<font color="#467546">They pale in comparison to this place.</font>

781
00:49:12,391 --> 00:49:15,656
<font color="#467546">...I honestly just want to take a break,</font>

782
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:17,697
<font color="#467546">go back to those wetlands,</font>

783
00:49:17,698 --> 00:49:20,146
<font color="#467546">and just <i>relax</i> for a moment.</font>

784
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:24,228
<font color="#467546">Or perhaps, those gardens. Those are a bit closer by.</font>

785
00:49:26,752 --> 00:49:30,425
<font color="#467546">I do see the beauty of places like this.</font>

786
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,466
<font color="#467546">I really do.</font>

787
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:35,324
<font color="#467546">It's just, harder, when they're so lethal.</font>

788
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:38,590
<font color="#467546">It seems like I've reached the end though.</font>

789
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:42,672
<font color="#467546">This door is huge, and I sense someone behind it.</font>

790
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:45,938
<font color="#467546">Of course the halfway point is being guarded.</font>

791
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:47,979
<font color="#467546">Why wouldn't it be?</font>

792
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,000
<font color="#467546">Time to get this Memory.</font>

793
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,449
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">What will be his name, milord?</font>

794
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,490
<font color="#a34242">...</font>

795
00:49:58,491 --> 00:50:01,348
<font color="#a34242">He shall be Lord of the Earth,</font>

796
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,430
<font color="#a34242">the lion whose claws shall quench the fires of Hell,</font>

797
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:07,879
<font color="#a34242">who bestows upon man their wings.</font>

798
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,328
<font color="#a34242">So His name shall be Ariel,</font>

799
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:14,002
<font color="#a34242">and the Old Earth shall run through His veins.</font>

800
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:16,043
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">"Ariel"... Beautiful, milord.</font>

801
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:18,901
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Look at his eyes, aren’t they magical?</font>

802
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:20,942
<font color="#a34242">Ice-white, like yours once were.</font>

803
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:24,616
<font color="#a34242">See? All is as told; He is our King.</font>

804
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:28,290
<font color="#a34242">And you have always been destined to bear Him.</font>

805
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,331
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

806
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:33,597
<font color="#a34242">The pilgrims are here. The gates shall open.</font>

807
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:37,679
<font color="#a34242">Sing Him a song, and wear your mask with grace.</font>

808
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,812
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Little Ariel, how softly your heart beats...</font>

809
00:50:43,813 --> 00:50:46,670
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Your blank little heart, free from desire.</font>

810
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:48,711
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">May it remain pure forevermore.</font>

811
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,752
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

812
00:50:50,753 --> 00:50:55,650
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">I pray you will grow up a better man than your father.</font>

813
00:50:58,926 --> 00:51:00,966
<font color="#a34242">Greetings, Auzandil. How is Ariel?</font>

814
00:51:00,967 --> 00:51:06,273
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Come in, dear! Oh how I’ve missed you. How was your time at-</font>

815
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:08,314
<font color="#a34242">Answer me. How is Ariel?</font>

816
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,580
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He walks and talks, he reads and writes...</font>

817
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:14,029
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He even reflects on his meditations.</font>

818
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,295
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He is growing into a wise prince, milord.</font>

819
00:51:17,296 --> 00:51:20,561
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">And yet, the curse has not taken him.</font>

820
00:51:20,562 --> 00:51:23,827
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He is perfect, milord. And so, so lovely.</font>

821
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:25,868
<font color="#a34242">Good. But remember:</font>

822
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:28,726
<font color="#a34242">Do not get too attached to Him.</font>

823
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:32,808
<font color="#a34242">His might far exceeds our own. <b>Do not forget that</b>.</font>

824
00:51:32,809 --> 00:51:35,666
<font color="#a34242">Soon, the young Messiah will join me.</font>

825
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:37,707
<font color="#a34242">Prepare Him for His travels.</font>

826
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,973
<font color="#a34242">Teach Him the words. Do not disappoint me.</font>

827
00:51:40,974 --> 00:51:43,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Understood, milord.</font>

828
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,494
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel, attend to your studies at once!</font>

829
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:51,448
<font color="#f1b178">No. This is where my mother sat.</font>

830
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:54,402
<font color="#f1b178">She was dreaming, father. And then, you...</font>

831
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,512
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">How oft must I reiterate!</font>

832
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,622
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Enough of this attachment!</font>

833
00:51:58,623 --> 00:52:01,576
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The King must ascend above His Kingdom.</font>

834
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:06,639
<font color="#f1b178">"...Ascend above The Kingdom, to cradle it from the clouds", said Teonan.</font>

835
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,015
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Silence! Do not talk back at me, Ariel.</font>

836
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:12,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Go and reflect on your actions.</font>

837
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,601
<font color="#f1b178">Go and reflect on how you slit her throat, father.</font>

838
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,849
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...Ariel. I have the League in my reins.</font>

839
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,285
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Without the League, you are NOTHING.</font>

840
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,533
<font color="#f1b178">Without your League, I am still the King.</font>

841
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,187
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel. Know that half the world wishes you dead.</font>

842
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,623
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The League is your sole refuge.</font>

843
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:36,495
<font color="#f1b178">If half the world wishes me dead, then let them kill me.</font>

844
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:39,743
<font color="#f1b178">I’ll become a martyr for the other half.</font>

845
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:45,021
<font color="#f1b178">The whole world shall sing my name toward the pike impaling your head.</font>

846
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:47,051
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You wasteful, manic imbecile.</font>

847
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,705
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Thousands of lives lie wasted within your livid mind.</font>

848
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:52,735
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You remember nothing, don’t you?!</font>

849
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,765
<font color="#f1b178">I do, father.</font>

850
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,201
<font color="#f1b178">"You shall perish of hunger, father."</font>

851
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:59,231
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Shut your mouth!</font>

852
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:02,479
<font color="#f1b178">"And your blood shall stain the desert storms."</font>

853
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,915
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">I’ll make you a martyr, alright!</font>

854
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,975
<font color="#f1b178">"You were a beast, and you shall die as such."</font>

855
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,000
<font color="#f1b178">Farewell, father.</font>

856
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:17,674
<font color="#b04d78">So, in the end it was all a lie.</font>

857
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:22,572
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">That's right. But it wasn't all for naught; 'cause I met you.</font>

858
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:25,430
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">And with that, all the world's beauty.</font>

859
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:29,104
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Do you hear the seagulls hovering over your head?</font>

860
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,370
<font color="#b04d78">And the sun rays shearing over the sea...</font>

861
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,636
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">And the fresh air breezing through your lungs...</font>

862
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:40,534
<font color="#b04d78">I'm proud to share these feelings with you, false King of Man.</font>

863
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:42,575
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Shut your mouth, piss-poor horse-herder.</font>

864
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:44,616
<font color="#b04d78">Thank you.</font>

865
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,657
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">No problem, brother.</font>

866
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:49,691
<font color="#b04d78">Look, Ariel, the sky has opened.</font>

867
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,732
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Unbelievable... Shall we stargaze?</font>

868
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:56,222
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">And read each other's fates, as did the Kings of old.</font>

869
00:53:56,223 --> 00:54:00,304
<font color="#b04d78">Intimate, isn't it? Surely, we too will fall in love.</font>

870
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,930
<font color="#b04d78">You know, Ariel.</font>

871
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:06,604
<font color="#b04d78">In another life, this could've been my journey's end.</font>

872
00:54:06,605 --> 00:54:09,462
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">It can still be. Join me, Sal.</font>

873
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,911
<font color="#b04d78">Where will you travel next, then?</font>

874
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:16,401
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">The Holy Land, brother. Did the stars not make that clear?</font>

875
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,850
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Join me; let's find peace together.</font>

876
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:21,299
<font color="#b04d78">Hmm... What do the stars foretell?</font>

877
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,565
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Damned be the stars. Choose your own path!</font>

878
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:29,055
<font color="#b04d78">But the stars are my path, Ariel, and you know that.</font>

879
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,681
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">Burning ambition and maniacal confusion.</font>

880
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,539
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">That's what I saw in your path.</font>

881
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,846
<font color="#b04d78">Sounds quite exciting to me. If that's my fate, then so be it.</font>

882
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:42,295
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">What a stubborn man you are.</font>

883
00:54:42,296 --> 00:54:44,336
<font color="#b04d78">Don’t worry, Ariel.</font>

884
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:48,000
<font color="#b04d78">Our fates may diverge, but this night is ours!</font>

885
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,878
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, by the stars, I should have known!</font>

886
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,010
<font color="#f1b178">By the charm in his forever-smile,</font>

887
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,497
<font color="#f1b178">by the splendor in his stilted speech,</font>

888
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,984
<font color="#f1b178">by the shimmer in his somber eyes...</font>

889
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:04,761
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known!</font>

890
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:08,314
<font color="#f1b178">I loved him, I loved him, I loved him dearly.</font>

891
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:11,512
<font color="#f1b178">That man with a mind serene as the stars,</font>

892
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:15,776
<font color="#f1b178">that man who dreamed to wed himself to life and its beauty.</font>

893
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:18,971
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, then, that he was still...</font>

894
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:22,645
<font color="#f1b178">...that bloodied cripple, who walked the meadows in mania.</font>

895
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,094
<font color="#f1b178">Cradling his kingdom from the clouds,</font>

896
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:27,952
<font color="#f1b178">to drown it in its own blood;</font>

897
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,401
<font color="#f1b178">he is rotten to the bone.</font>

898
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,075
<font color="#f1b178">I hate you, Sal. I hate all of you.</font>

899
00:55:37,488 --> 00:55:39,936
<font color="#f1b178">Mother, I am hating, forgive me.</font>

900
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,794
<font color="#f1b178">My son, I am hating, hear me.</font>

901
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:45,652
<font color="#f1b178">My daughter, I am hating, cleanse me.</font>

902
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:49,326
<font color="#f1b178">My better half, I am hating, stand with me.</font>

903
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,367
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

904
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:54,633
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I am hating, come to me.</font>

905
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:58,715
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I shall not hate, for I shall fight.</font>

906
00:55:58,716 --> 00:56:00,756
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, hear my prayer!</font>

907
00:56:04,169 --> 00:56:06,617
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You've finally made it, prince Ariel.</font>

908
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:08,658
<font color="#f1b178">...Greetings, venerable lady.</font>

909
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:11,924
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh poor thing, such stillness in your voice.</font>

910
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:16,006
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Have you seen your own eyes? How dejected, how determined.</font>

911
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:18,864
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">The journey. What did it cost you?</font>

912
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:20,905
<font color="#f1b178">Everything, venerable lady.</font>

913
00:56:20,906 --> 00:56:22,946
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Excellent. I know enough.</font>

914
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,395
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You, Ariel, will be my apprentice.</font>

915
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:27,436
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Now bow.</font>

916
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:29,477
<font color="#f1b178">Thank you, venerable lady.</font>

917
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:31,518
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Welcome to our crusade, Ariel.</font>

918
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:36,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Death to the King. Death to his Kingdom. Hail the Azachon.</font>

919
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:43,814
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

920
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:47,488
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

921
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:51,162
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

922
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,020
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Father, we hear footsteps in the distance.</font>

923
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,061
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a"><i>He</i> is here.</font>

924
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,735
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

925
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:03,409
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

926
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,090
<font color="#f1b178">My mind is a maelstrom and I see all.</font>

927
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,948
<font color="#f1b178">In this moment, I pervade every sensation.</font>

928
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:15,030
<font color="#f1b178">Be it the sensation of my body directing its dance,</font>

929
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,704
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my arm bending and bleeding,</font>

930
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,378
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my fingers weaving their song,</font>

931
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:26,460
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of scorn for the beast before me.</font>

932
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,726
<font color="#f1b178">At the apex of obsession, all is one.</font>

933
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,767
<font color="#f1b178">This beast shall be slain.</font>

934
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:36,040
<font color="#f1b178">Floors have shattered, the beast is pushing through.</font>

935
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:40,122
<font color="#f1b178">There is not a single emotion upon his disgusting face.</font>

936
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,571
<font color="#f1b178">Does there not linger Soeise's compassion,</font>

937
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:45,020
<font color="#f1b178">or Roeroan's rage or Teonan's guilt,</font>

938
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:48,286
<font color="#f1b178">or the beautiful reverence once harbored by Sal?</font>

939
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,327
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">You are hating, father.</font>

940
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,368
<font color="#f1b178">Speak, devil, speak!</font>

941
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,409
<font color="#f1b178">I beg of you, speak!</font>

942
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,865
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop, father, it hurts, it hurts!</font>

943
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,906
<font color="#f1b178"><b>Speak to me, brother!</b></font>

944
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,947
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop right now!</font>

945
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,805
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Retreat at once! Do it for me!</font>

946
00:58:04,806 --> 00:58:06,846
<font color="#f1b178">I must... not...</font>

947
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,887
<font color="#f1b178">Merely...</font>

948
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,928
<font color="#f1b178">Oh Azachon... almighty...</font>

949
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:12,969
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

950
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,000
<font color="#f1b178">Ah... I have... failed.</font>

951
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,858
<font color="#467546">What was that guy going on about?</font>

952
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:23,899
<font color="#467546">Me, a "beast"? A "devil"?</font>

953
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,165
<font color="#467546">These Memories contain nothing that warrant such words.</font>

954
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,431
<font color="#467546">...And these memories aren't mine to begin with.</font>

955
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,472
<font color="#467546">...Right?</font>

956
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:35,330
<font color="#467546">He also muttered something about the Eye.</font>

957
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:38,596
<font color="#467546">I'm simply doing what It requests of me.</font>

958
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:41,862
<font color="#467546">Doesn't that mean we're on the same side?</font>

959
00:58:41,863 --> 00:58:44,311
<font color="#467546">Then why attack me so fiercely?</font>

960
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,025
<font color="#467546">That fight really brought us down deep, huh.</font>

961
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,291
<font color="#467546">I can't even make out the ceiling anymore.</font>

962
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:56,149
<font color="#467546">This place was already ruined beyond belief...</font>

963
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:58,598
<font color="#467546">...but we didn't really help matters.</font>

964
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,088
<font color="#467546">I hope I can still find the Memory under the rubble.</font>

965
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:07,170
<font color="#467546">Though I do feel that this fight was more informative...</font>

966
00:59:07,171 --> 00:59:09,619
<font color="#467546">...than the Memory could ever be.</font>

967
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,885
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I could ask the Eye about this.</font>

968
00:59:15,334 --> 00:59:19,415
<font color="#467546">I thought it was because of all the fighting, but...</font>

969
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,456
<font color="#467546">It's <i>hot</i> down here.</font>

970
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:25,130
<font color="#467546">So much hotter than the caverns and ruins above.</font>

971
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:28,804
<font color="#467546">Yet, somehow, I don't feel affected by it, anymore.</font>

972
00:59:28,805 --> 00:59:32,478
<font color="#467546">I feel like I'm changing the deeper I'm going.</font>

973
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:36,152
<font color="#467546">I don't need to sleep as much anymore, either.</font>

974
00:59:36,153 --> 00:59:38,193
<font color="#467546">My appetite's also disappeared.</font>

975
00:59:38,194 --> 00:59:41,051
<font color="#467546">I guess that's all a good thing.</font>

976
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:45,949
<font color="#467546">Sleep and meals in a place like this are only a bother.</font>

977
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,438
<font color="#467546">Time to cross this gate.</font>

978
00:59:50,439 --> 00:59:54,928
<font color="#467546">I really hope that whatever adventure awaits on the other side...</font>

979
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:59,000
<font color="#467546">...will be kinder to me than my journey so far.</font>
