1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,920
<font color="#467546">I was dreaming just now,</font>

2
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:16,610
<font color="#467546">and I dreamt of an eye.</font>

3
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:20,300
<font color="#467546">Now, I forgot, I wonder...</font>

4
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:24,000
<font color="#467546">Who am I?</font>

5
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,922
<font color="#467546">Mom, where have you gone? Dad, where are you hiding?</font>

6
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,421
<font color="#467546">Well, let's go.</font>

7
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:35,462
<font color="#467546">I walk above the clouds.</font>

8
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,320
<font color="#467546">And the clouds have strings and wings.</font>

9
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:41,178
<font color="#467546">And the wind from these clouds, sings.</font>

10
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:46,485
<font color="#467546">So I asked the wind in reply, if it could make me fly.</font>

11
00:00:46,486 --> 00:00:52,608
<font color="#467546">But I only ever head the wind cry, so all I did was walk on.</font>

12
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:58,345
<font color="#467546">Towers are rising from the clouds.</font>

13
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:01,203
<font color="#467546">And these towers are old, and dusty.</font>

14
00:01:01,204 --> 00:01:03,652
<font color="#467546">Wizards play with strings and wings.</font>

15
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:07,734
<font color="#467546">And they ever watch the skies, where no bird flies.</font>

16
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,816
<font color="#467546">I wish to sometime see them with my own eyes.</font>

17
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:15,898
<font color="#467546">I once asked the wizards, why the birds don't fly.</font>

18
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,164
<font color="#467546">And they said: because of the bells' cry.</font>

19
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:23,654
<font color="#467546">This made me sad, so all I did was walk on.</font>

20
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:31,024
<font color="#467546">And I remember now, that indeed it was the bells,</font>

21
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,065
<font color="#467546">that had woken me up.</font>

22
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:37,147
<font color="#467546">It was the bells that had shown me this sky.</font>

23
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:42,045
<font color="#467546">But the bells are brittle, and a breeze could make them fall.</font>

24
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:46,943
<font color="#467546">And the towers are tall, so I give the wizards my thanks,</font>

25
00:01:46,944 --> 00:01:50,209
<font color="#467546">and then all I did was walk on.</font>

26
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,538
<font color="#467546">The bells are tolling again.</font>

27
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,579
<font color="#467546">Tolling again in the distance.</font>

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,886
<font color="#467546">And the bells are telling me again, that only they hold the answers.</font>

29
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:06,152
<font color="#467546">And I know, that that is the truth.</font>

30
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#467546">So all I did was walk on.</font>

31
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:15,490
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the wizards that words reveal the world.</font>

32
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:18,348
<font color="#467546">For example, they taught me to see.</font>

33
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,614
<font color="#467546">See that there are mountains in the wind.</font>

34
00:02:21,615 --> 00:02:24,472
<font color="#467546">See that flower forests grow atop them.</font>

35
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:28,962
<font color="#467546">And See all the of good, and all of the bad.</font>

36
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:34,110
<font color="#467546">I have found myself under the large petals,</font>

37
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,968
<font color="#467546">and I have rested here for years.</font>

38
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:41,866
<font color="#467546">I have befriended the bugs, and have found in them my peers.</font>

39
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,315
<font color="#467546">I was taught by the bugs,</font>

40
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,764
<font color="#467546">that wizards are made of wisps,</font>

41
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,213
<font color="#467546">and wisps are made of waxcaps.</font>

42
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:52,071
<font color="#467546">I was also taught by the bugs,</font>

43
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,337
<font color="#467546">that left is left, and right is right.</font>

44
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:59,011
<font color="#467546">Oh, how beautiful it is to know the world.</font>

45
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:03,093
<font color="#467546">Oh, how much more I want them to teach me.</font>

46
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,649
<font color="#467546">The bugs teach me everything I want to know.</font>

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,731
<font color="#467546">And they teach me everything I don't want to know.</font>

48
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:16,813
<font color="#467546">Hours pass, days pass, years pass, we started aeons ago...</font>

49
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:20,487
<font color="#467546">There is always more of this beauty to show.</font>

50
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,635
<font color="#467546">But bugs say that they know my name.</font>

51
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:28,493
<font color="#467546">Yet they never teach it to me.</font>

52
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:32,983
<font color="#467546">And when I ask, they say that they need not teach,</font>

53
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,432
<font color="#467546">the things that I already know.</font>

54
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:40,739
<font color="#467546">And that I need not feel bad, for knowing that I am me.</font>

55
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,111
<font color="#467546">But this time I'll sneak away, sneak away to the bells.</font>

56
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:51,999
<font color="#467546">For the bugs must be lying, for I know not my name.</font>

57
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:59,307
<font color="#467546">I hear the bells tolling in the tunnels that run beneath the soil.</font>

58
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:03,797
<font color="#467546">The bugs had told me to never ever enter these tunnels.</font>

59
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,063
<font color="#467546">They skitter and scatter, they blather and chatter.</font>

60
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:11,145
<font color="#467546">But I believe not their lies, I ignore their advise.</font>

61
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:14,003
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look what lies deeper inside.</font>

62
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,901
<font color="#467546">I walk and I walk, I can't see the sky any more.</font>

63
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:22,167
<font color="#467546">These tunnels are warm, maybe even too warm.</font>

64
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,249
<font color="#467546">The warmth guides me deep, it lulls me to sleep.</font>

65
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,107
<font color="#467546">I stop walking, I sit down, and...</font>

66
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:34,005
<font color="#467546">But the bells toll again, wake me up again,</font>

67
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:37,271
<font color="#467546">and remind me that I must not sleep.</font>

68
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,312
<font color="#467546">So I start walking again,</font>

69
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,986
<font color="#467546">I go to where the bugs don't dare creep.</font>

70
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:48,293
<font color="#467546">I go left, I go right, but there is no bell in sight.</font>

71
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:52,783
<font color="#467546">But still, my ears hear them. Why can't I find them?</font>

72
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:54,824
<font color="#467546">Did I do something wrong?</font>

73
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,273
<font color="#467546">Do the bells not want me?</font>

74
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:02,171
<font color="#467546">I just want to know my name, and a place to belong...</font>

75
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:05,437
<font color="#467546">They bells toll me I am doing great.</font>

76
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,703
<font color="#467546">And that I need to keep walking on.</font>

77
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:11,152
<font color="#467546">But the bells, but the bugs,</font>

78
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:14,418
<font color="#467546">they seem to not let me See me.</font>

79
00:05:15,643 --> 00:05:17,683
<font color="#467546">I turn around, I'm sad,</font>

80
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,132
<font color="#467546">ignoring the bugs, was that bad?</font>

81
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,173
<font color="#467546">I wander through the tunnels.</font>

82
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,439
<font color="#467546">I go right, I go left, and finally,</font>

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
<font color="#467546">brighter light enters my sight.</font>

84
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:31,562
<font color="#467546">I go back to the bugs, I want to apologize,</font>

85
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:34,000
<font color="#467546">but they don't crawl here anymore.</font>

86
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:42,082
<font color="#467546">I don't know for how long I have been walking.</font>

87
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,348
<font color="#467546">There's only my tummy to tell the time.</font>

88
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,022
<font color="#467546">A single cactus lasts me a long, long, while.</font>

89
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,471
<font color="#467546">And now, ruins lie before me.</font>

90
00:05:51,472 --> 00:05:54,329
<font color="#467546">The bells do not like these ruins.</font>

91
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,003
<font color="#467546">Just like the bugs do not like the bells.</font>

92
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:02,085
<font color="#467546">And again, I decide to ignore both, to step inside.</font>

93
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,126
<font color="#467546">I explore a bit, but...</font>

94
00:06:06,821 --> 00:06:08,796
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Hey, you!</font>

95
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:11,958
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look up, you, look me in the eye!</font>

96
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,934
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Splendid! Our gazes finally meet.</font>

97
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,910
<font color="#467546">Who... what...</font>

98
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,886
<font color="#467546">What are you?!</font>

99
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:19,862
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I am your guide, child.</font>

100
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:21,838
<font color="#467546">My... guide?</font>

101
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,395
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Look at me, See me, take yourself into me.</font>

102
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,371
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">I will reveal your purpose.</font>

103
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:29,347
<font color="#467546">No, no, Eye, you're scary...</font>

104
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,323
<font color="#467546">Please, please, let me go!</font>

105
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:36,461
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">It is not quite time to explain what it is that you see.</font>

106
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,623
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">You need only know that you are Me.</font>

107
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,599
<font color="#467546">And that I am You?</font>

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,575
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Yes, and that You are...</font>

109
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,551
<font color="#467546">Me. Listen, child.</font>

110
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:49,108
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Dedicate Yourself to Me, and all will become clear.</font>

111
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:53,060
<font color="#467546">I dedicate Myself to You, oh great Eye of Me.</font>

112
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:57,012
<font color="#467546">Good. Then, I shall have you do, one simple request.</font>

113
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:59,384
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">You must Remember who You are.</font>

114
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,360
<font color="#467546">And Whom You love.</font>

115
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:05,312
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">See... all of the Angels have gone away to Fight.</font>

116
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:08,869
<font color="#467546">Fly, Child, fly down quickly and Join their Strife.</font>

117
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,031
<font class="speaker2" color="#33339f">Lest You will gnaw at Yourself and Forget,</font>

118
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="#467546">The Meaning Of Your Life.</font>

119
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,266
<font color="#467546">So the Eye, too, knows who I am...</font>

120
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:21,532
<font color="#467546">And the Eye, too, refuses to tell me.</font>

121
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:25,614
<font color="#467546">But if the Eye is Me, shouldn't I know too?</font>

122
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:27,655
<font color="#467546">My head hurts...</font>

123
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,921
<font color="#467546">But I, the Eye, we made a promise.</font>

124
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:34,595
<font color="#467546">If I do as he says, will I remember?</font>

125
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,840
<font color="#467546">But I cannot fly.</font>

126
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,922
<font color="#467546">And bells toll in the distance, away from the I.</font>

127
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:44,963
<font color="#467546">Who can I trust?</font>

128
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,004
<font color="#467546">Who should I follow?</font>

129
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,045
<font color="#467546">Are His words just hollow?</font>

130
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:53,127
<font color="#467546">Or will the bells lead me to dust and sorrow?</font>

131
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,576
<font color="#467546">I don't know, I don't know!</font>

132
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,821
<font color="#467546">Finally, I decide.</font>

133
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:02,679
<font color="#467546">I want to search far and wide.</font>

134
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,537
<font color="#467546">And I did not see everything yet.</font>

135
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:07,986
<font color="#467546">Nor did I See everything yet.</font>

136
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,068
<font color="#467546">I walk out of the gate, I jump over rocks,</font>

137
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,334
<font color="#467546">I see some houses, and I go there.</font>

138
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:19,000
<font color="#467546">I wonder if there is anything they will share?</font>

139
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,674
<font color="#467546">So this is that "King" the Eye talked about.</font>

140
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,715
<font color="#467546">...</font>

141
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,389
<font color="#467546">I'm climbing across floating rocks much smaller than before.</font>

142
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,512
<font color="#467546">They've been eroded by the wind, and are covered with a thin layer of sand.</font>

143
00:08:38,513 --> 00:08:42,594
<font color="#467546">But still, there's a surprising amount of plants growing here.</font>

144
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:46,268
<font color="#467546">They grow as tall as buildings. They feel... imposing.</font>

145
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:49,126
<font color="#467546">Between these plants lies a ruined town.</font>

146
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:53,208
<font color="#467546">The centerpiece, a large... pyramid? With a statue on top.</font>

147
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,249
<font color="#467546">It's surprisingly intact.</font>

148
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,290
<font color="#467546">So this is that "King".</font>

149
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:01,372
<font color="#467546">Cannot say I'd be thrilled to live under his rule.</font>

150
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,821
<font color="#467546">Mostly because everyone's gone already, hehe.</font>

151
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:07,087
<font color="#467546">(This solitude... No one to even joke with...)</font>

152
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:17,036
<font color="#467546">There's still quite some stuff left to scavenge.</font>

153
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:20,710
<font color="#467546">It's pretty weird how these fruits haven't spoiled yet.</font>

154
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,751
<font color="#467546">...</font>

155
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:26,833
<font color="#467546">If this isn't a dream, like the Eye told me...</font>

156
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,282
<font color="#467546">...then why does nothing make sense?</font>

157
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:31,731
<font color="#467546">And why don't I remember anything?</font>

158
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:36,221
<font color="#467546">Certainly, this breeze feels warm and dry, and very much life-like.</font>

159
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:39,487
<font color="#467546">But we've all had dreams like this before.</font>

160
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:42,345
<font color="#467546">And dreams within dreams, for that matter.</font>

161
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:45,203
<font color="#467546">I'll judge what reality is to me.</font>

162
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:47,244
<font color="#467546"><i>And this isn't it</i>.</font>

163
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,968
<font color="#467546">Let's go visit that pyramid.</font>

164
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,000
<font color="#467546">I'm curious about that statue.</font>

165
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:06,898
<font color="#467546">From nearby, it's less of a "pyramid", and more of a "tower".</font>

166
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,347
<font color="#467546">The inside is also pretty spacious.</font>

167
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:12,613
<font color="#467546">There is this huge pillar in the center.</font>

168
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:17,920
<font color="#467546">It's made of the same sickly yellow rock as the masses all around.</font>

169
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,778
<font color="#467546">The green coral and lava's here, too.</font>

170
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,268
<font color="#467546">But there is also some curious liquid dripping from the top.</font>

171
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,350
<font color="#467546">It looks somewhat crimson or purple, and is glowing faintly.</font>

172
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:33,840
<font color="#467546">It's leaking from the ceiling far above into the depths below.</font>

173
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,881
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>...</font>

174
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:37,922
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

175
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:39,963
<font color="#467546"><i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>... <i>Drip</i>...</font>

176
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:43,637
<font color="#467546">For the first time, an acute feeling of dread.</font>

177
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,086
<font color="#467546">I dare not touch that liquid.</font>

178
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:48,944
<font color="#467546">It just keeps dripping into the below...</font>

179
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:51,802
<font color="#467546">Huh, below this "pyramid" is another structure.</font>

180
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:54,660
<font color="#467546">Strange pathways, symmetrical and suspended in mid-air.</font>

181
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,701
<font color="#467546">Turning. Very, very slowly.</font>

182
00:10:56,702 --> 00:10:59,967
<font color="#467546">Much quicker is the sandstorm engulfing the paths.</font>

183
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:02,825
<font color="#467546">I must go to the bottom-most layer.</font>

184
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:05,274
<font color="#467546">Why? I couldn't even tell you.</font>

185
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,315
<font color="#467546">Just a hunch.</font>

186
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:12,622
<font color="#467546">I carefully make my way down from my safe haven inside the pyramid.</font>

187
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:16,704
<font color="#467546">But... I can't continue like this. I need to jump.</font>

188
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:21,194
<font color="#467546">It's only a few meters, but that's still quite a leap!</font>

189
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,868
<font color="#467546">...I thought I couldn't get scared in this dream?</font>

190
00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:26,909
<font color="#467546">I jump..</font>

191
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,950
<font color="#467546">...</font>

192
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:30,991
<font color="#467546">...and land.</font>

193
00:11:30,992 --> 00:11:33,032
<font color="#467546">However, the storm is intense...</font>

194
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,073
<font color="#467546">I tumble towards the edge.</font>

195
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:37,114
<font color="#467546">I tumble off the edge.</font>

196
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,155
<font color="#467546">Freefalling.</font>

197
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,196
<font color="#467546">Fainting.</font>

198
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,041
<font color="#f1b178">At last, the surface...</font>

199
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,490
<font color="#f1b178">To have finally reached up here...</font>

200
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:56,980
<font color="#f1b178">This place is always so much more perilous than it seems.</font>

201
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,429
<font color="#f1b178">What dangers will this grove hold?</font>

202
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,470
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You did well, child.</font>

203
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,328
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Your journey is almost at its end.</font>

204
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:07,186
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Do not falter in its final steps.</font>

205
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:12,084
<font color="#f1b178">I only did well because I didn't run into <i>them</i> this time.</font>

206
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:15,350
<font color="#f1b178">It was nothing but a stroke of luck.</font>

207
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:18,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Child, do not concern yourself with such trivialities.</font>

208
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,657
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">We are up here now.</font>

209
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:24,739
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You ought to feel a sense of pride for this.</font>

210
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,780
<font color="#f1b178">You are right, my lady.</font>

211
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:29,229
<font color="#f1b178">Soon, I will finally reach Harmony.</font>

212
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:41,004
<font color="#f1b178">Venerable lady, I must confess.</font>

213
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,045
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Speak your heart, child.</font>

214
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:45,086
<font color="#f1b178">The stream stirs so silently...</font>

215
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,535
<font color="#f1b178">The springs bubble with such delight...</font>

216
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:51,617
<font color="#f1b178">The stars wax and wane... the sky waves and wanders...</font>

217
00:12:51,618 --> 00:12:54,475
<font color="#f1b178">I see such beauty in this land.</font>

218
00:12:54,476 --> 00:12:56,516
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Does that surprise you?</font>

219
00:12:56,517 --> 00:13:00,598
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Did you not expect beauty, here in the cosmic midst?</font>

220
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,639
<font color="#f1b178">I don't know.</font>

221
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,721
<font color="#f1b178">It's just... the things they tell back home, they're different.</font>

222
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:08,762
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Nonetheless, they are true.</font>

223
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:11,620
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Beauty to one is horror to another.</font>

224
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,478
<font color="#f1b178">Then what does that say about me?</font>

225
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,744
<font color="#f1b178">One who finds such beauty in the defiled?</font>

226
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:22,642
<font color="#f1b178">I'm aware of its evils, and the taint that stains its sky...</font>

227
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:25,500
<font color="#f1b178">But I'm still inclined to love, somehow.</font>

228
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:27,949
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">It's all a matter of perception.</font>

229
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,215
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Only a right view may penetrate this illusion.</font>

230
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,664
<font color="#f1b178">Then do I simply lack wisdom?</font>

231
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:36,522
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh, dear, I'd never accuse you thereof!</font>

232
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,971
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">But indeed, you do lack wisdom.</font>

233
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,000
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

234
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:50,307
<font color="#954444">Records of the ██th Year of the ███ Era, ██ / ██. Noon.</font>

235
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,348
<font color="#954444">And the father said:</font>

236
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,022
<font color="#954444">For as long as ye have known the lass,</font>

237
00:13:56,023 --> 00:14:00,512
<font color="#954444">He has been amongst ye, and He has prayed for ye;</font>

238
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:05,819
<font color="#954444">For as long as ye have seen the stars, He has ruled them.</font>

239
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,493
<font color="#954444">The father commanded his servants to embalm the girl.</font>

240
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:14,800
<font color="#954444">To baptize her in milk, and to offer her to the stars, faraway.</font>

241
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:17,249
<font color="#954444">And then her brother wept, crying:</font>

242
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,147
<font color="#954444">I won't let the stars steal her away, she is ours forever!</font>

243
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:24,188
<font color="#954444">This disappointed the father.</font>

244
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,229
<font color="#954444">He told him then:</font>

245
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,719
<font color="#954444">She will return with the King when the time is nigh.</font>

246
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,168
<font color="#954444">When from the stars He descends.</font>

247
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:36,434
<font color="#954444">And when He takes our throne once more.</font>

248
00:14:36,435 --> 00:14:39,700
<font color="#954444">With the King, we walk the world eternal.</font>

249
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:45,415
<font color="#954444">The father waved his hand, watched the sky, and made disappear all the threads.</font>

250
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:49,089
<font color="#954444">It was day; only the brightest stars were visible.</font>

251
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,130
<font color="#954444">He continued his lecture:</font>

252
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,579
<font color="#954444">This is our kingdom, my child.</font>

253
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,661
<font color="#954444">Whatever may disappear is ne'er gone, such is the sky.</font>

259
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,591
<font color="#954444">Unite!</font>

260
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:26,040
<font color="#954444">He and His bride have settled,</font>

261
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,122
<font color="#954444">The stars have aligned to open the path to quintessence.</font>

262
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:32,980

266
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:44,002
<font color="#954444">We all have been chosen.</font>

267
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,860
<font color="#954444">We all must choose to embrace it.</font>

270
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:04,531
<font color="#954444">We have heard some Brothers express doubt during the last Sabbath.</font>

271
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:07,389
<font color="#954444">Hearing this fills me with profound sadness.</font>

272
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,471
<font color="#954444">But while it goes without saying, remember your Masters' teachings.</font>

<font color="#954444">Surely, you are aware of the consequences of denouncing the League in this manner.</font>

274
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:24,234
<font color="#954444">For aeons, We have upheld tradition, all for this moment to finally arrive.</font>

275
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:28,724
<font color="#954444">Thousands of ancestors did not live to see this glorious day,</font>

276
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,990
<font color="#954444">but our patience has at last been rewarded.</font>

277
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,888
<font color="#954444">We shall welcome the harbinger of a new era in twenty-seven days.</font>

278
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:40,562
<font color="#954444">I must emphasize the importance of upholding tradition henceforth.</font>

279
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:44,236
<font color="#954444">Only by imitating the past can we guarantee success.</font>

280
00:16:45,978 --> 00:16:51,284
<font color="#954444">As tradition foretells, we shall welcome all who wish to see His face.</font>

281
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:55,774
<font color="#954444">But to the Brothers who still harbor doubt, I say this:</font>

282
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,815
<font color="#954444">Come!</font>

283
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,673
<font color="#954444">After seeing Him with your own eyes,</font>

284
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,939
<font color="#954444">your doubts shall vanish like fungus in quintessence.</font>

285
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,205
<font color="#954444">The Stars have guided us to this moment.</font>

286
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:10,471
<font color="#954444">Hereafter, the Stars shall continue to guide us.</font>

287
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:14,553
<font color="#954444">Even if we cannot see them, we shall follow them.</font>

288
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:19,043
<font color="#954444">Even if the sky is obscured, we shall consult the quintessence.</font>

289
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:22,717
<font color="#954444">If ever you are in doubt, rely on tradition.</font>

290
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,540
<font color="#954444">Finally, we will be restructuring certain ranks within the League.</font>

291
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:33,030
<font color="#954444">If you believe your lineage may be affected, please visit us.</font>

292
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,296
<font color="#954444">In pursuit of efficiency, we recommend coming alone.</font>

293

460
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:48,082
<font color="#467546">...let's break this huge window and get out of here.</font>

461
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,531
<font color="#467546">I can't stand this "quintessence" stuff.</font>

462
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:52,572
<font color="#467546">A good three whacks, and...</font>

463
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:54,613
<font color="#467546">it shatters.</font>

464
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:58,695
<font color="#467546">The liquid doesn't even spill, it just floats in place.</font>

465
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:03,593
<font color="#467546">After climbing through, my face is greeted by the warm subterranean air.</font>

466
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:07,675
<font color="#467546">All my senses are under constant attack in this cavern.</font>

467
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:09,716
<font color="#467546">Most jarringly, hearing.</font>

468
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:13,798
<font color="#467546">What causes these reverberations? What is all of this noise?</font>

469
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,247
<font color="#467546">Do those glowing plants cause it?</font>

470
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:19,105
<font color="#467546">Do they also cause this rotten smell?</font>

471
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:28,083
<font color="#467546">In the middle of this cavern is this huge pillar.</font>

472
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:30,941
<font color="#467546">Near the top, it splits into four.</font>

473
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:34,207
<font color="#467546">And then each branch, again, splits into four.</font>

474
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,248
<font color="#467546">Repeating, seemingly infinitely.</font>

475
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:41,555
<font color="#467546">Like the cathedral just now, it's made of the same sickly yellow rock.</font>

476
00:28:41,556 --> 00:28:44,821
<font color="#467546">I'm all too familiar with it by now.</font>

477
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,862
<font color="#467546">With the same green growths...</font>

478
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:50,128
<font color="#467546">I'm also all too familiar with, by now.</font>

479
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:52,577
<font color="#467546">The fissures looks somewhat like writing.</font>

480
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:55,026
<font color="#467546">Of course, I cannot read it.</font>

481
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:59,108
<font color="#467546">I look down. The pillar goes into a lake below.</font>

482
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:02,782
<font color="#467546">And then, it burrows even deeper into the ground.</font>

483
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:07,272
<font color="#467546">The lake seems to contain the same liquid as everything else.</font>

484
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:11,354
<font color="#467546">From this high up, the purple crimson seems to twinkle.</font>

485
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:13,395
<font color="#467546">Twinkling like the stars outside.</font>

486
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:15,436
<font color="#467546">It's almost inviting.</font>

487
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:17,477
<font color="#467546">But I won't.</font>

488
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:21,151
<font color="#467546">Instead, I look around the rest of the cave.</font>

489
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:24,417
<font color="#467546">There are four bridges extending from the pillar.</font>

490
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:30,132
<font color="#467546">The center seems like as good a place as any to set up camp.</font>

491
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,000
<font color="#467546">This place is pleasing to the senses.</font>

492
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:45,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

493
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:48,715
<font color="#954444">I begged her to never open her eyes again.</font>

494
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:53,205
<font color="#954444">Whatever she dreams of is not fit for one so innocent.</font>

495
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:55,246
<font color="#954444">Her expressions when sleeping...</font>

496
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:57,287
<font color="#954444">Her demeanor when awake...</font>

497
00:29:57,288 --> 00:30:00,961
<font color="#954444">I pray to you, let those dreams be dreams.</font>

498
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:03,002
<font color="#954444">No one deserves such dreams.</font>

499
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:08,717
<font color="#954444">While my daughter has yet the ability to smile, allow her to do so.</font>

500
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:11,575
<font color="#954444">I beg of you, Queen of Starlight...</font>

501
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:22,911
<font color="#954444">When I first found her, I saw faint starlight in her eyes.</font>

502
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:26,177
<font color="#954444">I knew for certain she was the one.</font>

503
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:29,035
<font color="#954444">Initially, I chose her for her talent,</font>

504
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:34,342
<font color="#954444">but now I can only see someone I have to protect from themselves.</font>

505
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:38,424
<font color="#954444">I can only muster so much dedication in a lifetime.</font>

506
00:30:38,425 --> 00:30:42,914
<font color="#954444">A single pupil is enough to last me until my death.</font>

507
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:48,629
<font color="#954444">I hope that she understands that, even if not by blood, she's my child.</font>

508
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,078
<font color="#954444">And I love her for it.</font>

509
00:30:57,517 --> 00:31:01,598
<font color="#954444">And now, the time has come for me to choose.</font>

510
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,639
<font color="#954444">Will I protect my daughter?</font>

511
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,905
<font color="#954444">Or will I stay true to my creed?</font>

512
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,946
<font color="#954444">I have always been loyal.</font>

513
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,212
<font color="#954444">So I beg of you, Queen of Starlight.</font>

514
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:14,253
<font color="#954444">Whatever my choice may be.</font>

515
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:17,519
<font color="#954444">Whether I become a sinner or a saint...</font>

516
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,968
<font color="#954444">Please accept my decision with grace.</font>

517
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,000
<font color="#954444">Signed, ▓▒███▓▒</font>

518
00:31:26,001 --> 00:31:28,041
<font color="#954444">To Queen of Starlight,</font>

519
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,715
<font color="#954444">I've lied to her ever since I knew her.</font>

520
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:34,573
<font color="#954444">Yet it was all for her sake.</font>

521
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:39,471
<font color="#954444">And for as long as she didn't notice, she was indeed happy.</font>

522
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:44,369
<font color="#954444">For thirteen years, she was the happiest girl I had ever seen.</font>

523
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,818
<font color="#954444">I couldn't have asked for more.</font>

524
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,022
<font color="#954444">However,</font>

525
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:56,104
<font color="#954444">As her mental condition deteriorated, the lies failed to uphold.</font>

526
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:58,553
<font color="#954444">Lately, she acted out in rage.</font>

527
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:02,635
<font color="#954444">I had to confine her before it was too late.</font>

528
00:32:02,636 --> 00:32:05,084
<font color="#954444">Rather understandably, she hates me now.</font>

529
00:32:05,085 --> 00:32:07,125
<font color="#954444">...</font>

530
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,391
<font color="#954444">My own daughter earnestly wishes for my disappearance.</font>

531
00:32:10,392 --> 00:32:15,698
<font color="#954444">If it continues like this, it won't be long before the world notices.</font>

532
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:18,964
<font color="#954444">I committed acts not worthy of your ears.</font>

533
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:25,087
<font color="#954444">The starlight in her eyes kept on growing, and so I became overwhelmed with distress.</font>

534
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,536
<font color="#954444">They had to be shut forever.</font>

535
00:32:27,537 --> 00:32:29,577
<font color="#954444">...</font>

536
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:35,598
<font color="#954444">But even half-blind, she managed to escape.</font>

537
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,456
<font color="#954444">I reckon this verdict pleases you greatly.</font>

538
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,722
<font color="#954444">It <i>is</i> your very own birth, after all.</font>

539
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:46,620
<font color="#954444">As for me, I don't think I can continue on any longer.</font>

540
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,069
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I love;</font>

541
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,518
<font color="#954444">I've betrayed the one I worship;</font>

542
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,376
<font color="#954444">and in doing so, I've betrayed myself.</font>

544
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,948
<font color="#954444">So.</font>

545
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,989
<font color="#954444">Queen of Starlight, my daughter.</font>

546
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,030
<font color="#954444">Like this we will part.</font>

547
00:33:07,031 --> 00:33:11,112
<font color="#954444">I pray for you to one day reach the end,</font>

548
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:13,970
<font color="#954444">just as I will soon reach mine.</font>

551
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,307
<font color="#467546">How unexpected. How wonderful.</font>

552
00:33:25,308 --> 00:33:30,614
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I can find books on what the eye refuses to tell me.</font>

553
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:33,063

564
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:37,307
<font color="#954444">If only we could understand Its true potential.</font>

565
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:39,348
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Remember your Master's Master?</font>

566
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:41,389
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">She advanced our understanding greatly.</font>

567
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,063
<font color="#954444">We have certainly been able to increase Its purity.</font>

<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Is your task then not the same? Follow in her footsteps.</font>

569
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:53,227
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Give us an even better view of the Starlight.</font>

570

578
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,240
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You ignored the last Sabbath's call.</font>

579
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:21,281
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Are you truly that busy?</font>

580
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:24,139
<font color="#954444">Did your Master not raise you properly?</font>

581
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,180
<font color="#954444">"Devote oneself to the Starlight."</font>

582
00:36:26,181 --> 00:36:29,038
<font color="#954444">You are a disgrace to our discipline.</font>

583
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,712
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">But <i>you</i> are the one who skipped <i>the Sabbath</i>.</font>

584
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:34,753
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">No research can justify that.</font>

585
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:36,794
<font color="#954444">I can taste the Starlight.</font>

586
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:41,171
<font color="#954444">This liquid is truly marvelous.</font>

587
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:43,620
<font color="#954444">I can see the stars twinkle.</font>

588
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:45,661
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Your condition has worsened again.</font>

589
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:50,968
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You really are on the right path. It seems you drew their ire.</font>

590
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:54,234
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">I heard they took over the other day?</font>

591
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:56,275
<font color="#954444">Ah yes...</font>

592
00:36:56,276 --> 00:37:00,357
<font color="#954444">The voices managed to break a few bones. Nothing more.</font>

593
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,031
<font color="#954444">Barely significant compared to those growths on my leg.</font>

594
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:06,480
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Have you tried watering them yet?</font>

595
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,521
<font color="#954444">Very funny.</font>

596
00:37:08,522 --> 00:37:10,562
<font color="#954444">...Actually...</font>

597
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:16,572
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">You are not supposed to cover yourself with quintessence.</font>

598
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:19,021
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">This has long been conventional wisdom.</font>

599
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:22,287
<font color="#954444">My mind is falling apart, I <i>need</i> this.</font>

600
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:25,553
<font color="#954444">I see glimpses of Starlight in my peripheral!</font>

601
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:28,411
<font color="#954444">Like my Master's Master! I <i>need</i> this!</font>

602
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,269
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">It is an inevitability of our research.</font>

603
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:36,167
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">But it is always so sad to see a dear friend go.</font>

604
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:39,433
<font color="#954444">I will not let those angels stop me.</font>

605
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:45,148
<font color="#954444">I am <i>so</i> close to reaching The Inner. <b>Lend me a hand.</b></font>

606
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:49,525
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Truly unfortunate.</font>

607
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:51,974
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">Only a pile of mush remains.</font>

608
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:54,015
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">His study, inaccessible. "Spores".</font>

609
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:57,281
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">He did not even leave a disciple behind.</font>

610
00:37:57,282 --> 00:38:00,547
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">I must thank my Master for his wisdom.</font>

611
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:04,221
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">"Do not lose sight of yourself when researching It."</font>

612
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:07,895
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">"They, and then you yourself, will turn you mad."</font>

613
00:38:07,896 --> 00:38:11,977
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">As long as we are careful, we can avoid <i>this</i>.</font>

614
00:38:11,978 --> 00:38:14,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#542525">My voices are only faint.</font>

615
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:20,041
<font color="#467546">What a view.</font>

616
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:26,012
<font color="#467546">So apparently, the world ends.</font>

617
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:28,053
<font color="#467546">Quite quickly, in fact.</font>

618
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:30,911
<font color="#467546">Here I am, sitting on the ledge.</font>

619
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,952
<font color="#467546">Gazing into the void.</font>

620
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:37,034
<font color="#467546">Nothing but the purple twilight that's become nostalgic by now.</font>

621
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:39,892
<font color="#467546">And the stars... They're so very pretty.</font>

622
00:38:39,893 --> 00:38:43,158
<font color="#467546">How they pulse, oscillate, fade in, fade out.</font>

623
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:45,607
<font color="#467546">Of course, they're not actually stars.</font>

624
00:38:45,608 --> 00:38:49,689
<font color="#467546">But who even cares about details like that any more?</font>

625
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,660
<font color="#467546">What was it like, before?</font>

626
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,334
<font color="#467546">What kind of night sky was I used to?</font>

627
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:02,600
<font color="#467546">Before I woke up in those floating towers?</font>

628
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,641
<font color="#467546">Could it be this pretty?</font>

629
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,090
<font color="#467546">I've been slowly satiating the Eye.</font>

630
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:11,172
<font color="#467546">In return, It blesses me with memories that aren't mine.</font>

631
00:39:11,173 --> 00:39:13,621
<font color="#467546">Things are gradually falling into place.</font>

632
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:18,111
<font color="#467546">Things are starting to make sense in their own, twisted way.</font>

633
00:39:18,112 --> 00:39:20,969
<font color="#467546">But this place still doesn't feel real.</font>

634
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,010
<font color="#467546">Is anything real?</font>

635
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,051
<font color="#467546">Was anything real before?</font>

636
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,092
<font color="#467546">Is there even a "before"?</font>

637
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:33,880
<font color="#467546">This one idiom suddenly comes to mind...</font>

638
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,921
<font color="#467546">The "call of the void"?</font>

639
00:39:35,922 --> 00:39:39,595
<font color="#467546">I've never heard it before... but it feels right.</font>

640
00:39:39,596 --> 00:39:42,044
<font color="#467546">There is no "bottom" below this.</font>

641
00:39:42,045 --> 00:39:44,085
<font color="#467546">Everything just becomes hazy.</font>

642
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:46,126
<font color="#467546">Everything just loses definition.</font>

643
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:50,208
<font color="#467546">This morbid curiosity of wanting to know what's down there.</font>

644
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,249
<font color="#467546">Or what <i>isn't</i> down there.</font>

645
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,853
<font color="#467546">Pretty weird, how even though it's an empty void...</font>

646
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,711
<font color="#467546">A lukewarm breeze flows through my hair.</font>

647
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:04,752
<font color="#467546">Where does it come from?</font>

648
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:06,793
<font color="#467546">...</font>

649
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:11,283
<font color="#467546">Nothing here makes sense, and <i>that</i> is what I'm concerned about?</font>

650
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,549
<font color="#467546">Heh, my mind really is in two places.</font>

651
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,998
<font color="#467546">The part that longs for home.</font>

652
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,447
<font color="#467546">The part that longs for here.</font>

653
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:22,305
<font color="#467546">I don't even know what "home" is.</font>

654
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:25,979
<font color="#467546">Not to mention, this place is becoming "home", too.</font>

655
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,020
<font color="#467546">Somehow.</font>

656
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,991
<font color="#467546">Enough monologuing.</font>

657
00:40:33,992 --> 00:40:38,073
<font color="#467546">No one here to listen to me babble on anyways.</font>

658
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:42,971
<font color="#467546">But I know I'll go insane if I don't talk to myself.</font>

659
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:45,000
<font color="#467546">Let's start moving again.</font>

660
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:53,490
<font color="#467546">Yuck, the quintessence in these caves is so much more potent.</font>

661
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:55,531

664
00:41:01,247 --> 00:41:05,736
<font color="#467546">I guess I should consider myself lucky I don't understand them.</font>

667
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:16,859

668
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,308
<font color="#467546">It seems almost sacred to them.</font>

669
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:21,757
<font color="#467546">From what I could understand, anyway.</font>

670
00:41:21,758 --> 00:41:25,431
<font color="#467546">Half the books I found are decayed beyond belief.</font>

671
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:29,105

738
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,899
<font color="#428686">How beautiful she's grown up to be!</font>

742
00:45:11,248 --> 00:45:15,737

<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">It was meant to be?</font>

754
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:02,349
<font color="#428686">See there, her heart of marble.</font>

755
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,390

762
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:22,760

766
00:46:28,884 --> 00:46:30,924
<font color="#428686">And have you not judged?</font>

767
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:40,392

768
00:46:40,393 --> 00:46:44,474
<font color="#428686">To love her rightly is to love all of her.</font>

771
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,822
<font class="speaker2" color="#f1b178">But I still need some time.</font>

772
00:46:51,823 --> 00:46:53,863
<font color="#428686">Do as you will.</font>

773
00:46:53,864 --> 00:46:56,721
<font color="#428686">Harmony is within you, stand and gaze!</font>

774
00:46:56,722 --> 00:46:59,987
<font color="#428686">Gaze at what the Heavens have gifted you!</font>

775
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,041
<font color="#467546">Screw these caves.</font>

776
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,899
<font color="#467546">They are large, hot, labyrinthine, and worse,</font>

777
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,757
<font color="#467546"><i>so</i> much more dangerous than those wetlands.</font>

778
00:47:18,758 --> 00:47:22,431
<font color="#467546">I've only collected what, like eight Memories so far?</font>

779
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:26,105
<font color="#467546">If only this place was a bit more generous...</font>

780
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:28,963
<font color="#467546">I would've long completed this stupid task.</font>

781
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:34,270
<font color="#467546">But I've agreed to it, so for the Eye's sake, I will continue.</font>

782
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:37,128
<font color="#467546">There's not much else to do, anyway.</font>

783
00:47:37,129 --> 00:47:39,169
<font color="#467546">...</font>

784
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:44,067
<font color="#467546">But I feel like I've found everything these caves have to offer.</font>

785
00:47:44,068 --> 00:47:48,149
<font color="#467546">There's that river, that cathedral, that <i>thing</i> in the center,</font>

786
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:52,231
<font color="#467546">that fungus place, that palace that gives me the creeps...</font>

787
00:47:52,232 --> 00:47:54,272
<font color="#467546">None lead me further.</font>

788
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:58,762
<font color="#467546">Surely I don't have to <i>dig</i> my way down, do I?</font>

789
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:06,592
<font color="#467546"><i>Finally</i>...</font>

790
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:09,450
<font color="#467546">I've been wandering these caves for ages,</font>

791
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:11,899
<font color="#467546">turning every stone like a madman...</font>

792
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,940
<font color="#467546">Why <i>here</i>, of all places!</font>

793
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:16,389
<font color="#467546">Ah, finally something to <i>do</i> again!</font>

794
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,036
<font color="#467546">Who put these traps in these ruins!</font>

795
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:28,710
<font color="#467546">It makes no sense. How do they still <i>work</i>?</font>

796
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:34,425
<font color="#467546">This place looks like it's designed to do one thing, and one thing only:</font>

797
00:48:34,426 --> 00:48:36,466
<font color="#467546">Kill. Specifically, me.</font>

798
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:40,140
<font color="#467546">Moreso than any other place I've been, at least.</font>

799
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,998
<font color="#467546">Usually the wildlife is the dangerous part...</font>

800
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:47,896
<font color="#467546">But here, the floor collapses, I get shot at out of nowhere...</font>

801
00:48:47,897 --> 00:48:51,570
<font color="#467546">I've even had the ceiling fall on me once!</font>

802
00:48:51,571 --> 00:48:54,428
<font color="#467546">This infernal heat is also something else.</font>

803
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:58,102
<font color="#467546">I really can't focus on my surroundings like this.</font>

804
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:01,368
<font color="#467546">To think I found those caves too dangerous...</font>

805
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,226
<font color="#467546">They pale in comparison to this place.</font>

806
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:09,533
<font color="#467546">...I honestly just want to take a break, go back to those wetlands...</font>

807
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:11,982
<font color="#467546">and just <i>relax</i> for a moment.</font>

808
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:16,064
<font color="#467546">Or perhaps, those gardens. Those are a bit closer by.</font>

809
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:20,146
<font color="#467546">(But then I'd need to go through that palace again...)</font>

810
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:29,609
<font color="#467546">I do see the beauty of places like this.</font>

811
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,650
<font color="#467546">I really do.</font>

812
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:35,324
<font color="#467546">It's just, harder, when they're trying to <i>kill me</i>.</font>

813
00:49:35,325 --> 00:49:38,590
<font color="#467546">It seems like I've reached the end though.</font>

814
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:42,672
<font color="#467546">This door is huge, and I sense someone behind it.</font>

815
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:45,938
<font color="#467546">Of course the halfway point is being guarded.</font>

816
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:47,979
<font color="#467546">Why wouldn't it be?</font>

817
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,000
<font color="#467546">Time to get this Memory.</font>

818
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,449
<font color="#eefc9a">What will be his name, milord?</font>

819
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,490
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...</font>

820
00:49:58,491 --> 00:50:01,348
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">He shall be Lord of the Earth,</font>

821
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:05,430
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">the lion whose claws shall quench the fires of Hell,</font>

822
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:07,879
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">who bestows upon man their wings.</font>

823
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,328
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">So His name shall be Ariel,</font>

824
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:14,002
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">and the Old Earth shall run through His veins.</font>

825
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:16,043
<font color="#eefc9a">"Ariel"... Beautiful, milord.</font>

826
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:18,901
<font color="#eefc9a">Look at his eyes, aren’t they magical?</font>

827
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:20,942
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ice-white, like yours once were.</font>

828
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:24,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">See? All is as told; He is our King.</font>

829
00:50:24,617 --> 00:50:28,290
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">And you have always been destined to bear Him.</font>

830
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,331
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

831
00:50:30,332 --> 00:50:33,597
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The pilgrims are here. The gates shall open.</font>

832
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:37,679
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Sing Him a song, and wear your mask with grace.</font>

833
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,608
<font color="#eefc9a">Little Ariel, how softly your heart beats...</font>

834
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:46,466
<font color="#eefc9a">Your blank little heart, free from desire.</font>

835
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:48,507
<font color="#eefc9a">May it remain pure forevermore.</font>

836
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:50,548
<font color="#eefc9a">...</font>

837
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:55,446
<font color="#eefc9a">I pray you will grow up a better man than your father.</font>

838
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:00,558
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Greetings, Auzandil. How is Ariel?</font>

839
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,865
<font color="#eefc9a">Come in, dear! Oh how I’ve missed you. How was your time at-</font>

840
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,906
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Answer me. How is Ariel?</font>

841
00:51:07,907 --> 00:51:11,988
<font color="#eefc9a">He walks and he talks, he reads and he writes...</font>

842
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:14,437
<font color="#eefc9a">He even reflects on his meditations.</font>

843
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,703
<font color="#eefc9a">He is growing into a wise prince, milord.</font>

844
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:20,969
<font color="#eefc9a">And yet, the curse has not taken him.</font>

845
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,235
<font color="#eefc9a">He is perfect, milord. And so, so lovely.</font>

846
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,276
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Good. But remember:</font>

847
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:28,725
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Do not get attached to Him.</font>

848
00:51:28,726 --> 00:51:32,807
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">His might far exceeds our own. <b>Do not forget this</b>.</font>

849
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,665
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Soon, the young Messiah will join me.</font>

850
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,706
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Prepare Him for His travels.</font>

851
00:51:37,707 --> 00:51:40,972
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Teach Him the words. Do not disappoint me.</font>

852
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:43,000
<font color="#eefc9a">Understood, milord.</font>

853
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:48,494
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel, attend to your studies at once!</font>

854
00:51:48,495 --> 00:51:51,448
<font color="#f1b178">No. This is where my mother sat.</font>

855
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:54,402
<font color="#f1b178">She was dreaming, father. And then, you...</font>

856
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,512
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">How oft must I reiterate!</font>

857
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,622
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Enough of this attachment!</font>

858
00:51:58,623 --> 00:52:01,576
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The King must ascend above His Kingdom.</font>

859
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:06,639
<font color="#f1b178">"...Ascend above The Kingdom, to cradle it from the clouds", said Teonan.</font>

860
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,015
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Silence! Do not talk back at me, Ariel.</font>

861
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:12,541
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Go and reflect on your actions.</font>

862
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,601
<font color="#f1b178">Go and reflect on how you slit her throat, father.</font>

863
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,849
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">...Ariel. I have the League in my reins.</font>

864
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:22,285
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Without the League, you are NOTHING.</font>

865
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:25,533
<font color="#f1b178">Without your League, I am still the King.</font>

866
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:29,187
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Ariel. Know that half the world wishes you dead.</font>

867
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,623
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">The League is your sole refuge.</font>

868
00:52:31,624 --> 00:52:36,495
<font color="#f1b178">If half the world wishes me dead, then let them kill me.</font>

869
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:39,743
<font color="#f1b178">I’ll become a martyr for the other half.</font>

870
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:45,021
<font color="#f1b178">The whole world shall sing my name toward the pike impaling your head.</font>

871
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:47,051
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You wasteful, manic imbecile.</font>

872
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,705
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Thousands of lives lie wasted within your livid mind.</font>

873
00:52:50,706 --> 00:52:52,735
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">You remember nothing, don’t you?!</font>

874
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,765
<font color="#f1b178">I do, father.</font>

875
00:52:54,766 --> 00:52:57,201
<font color="#f1b178">"You shall perish of hunger, father."</font>

876
00:52:57,202 --> 00:52:59,231
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">Shut your mouth!</font>

877
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:02,479
<font color="#f1b178">"And your blood shall stain the desert storms."</font>

878
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,915
<font class="speaker2" color="#a34242">I’ll make you a martyr, alright!</font>

879
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:08,975
<font color="#f1b178">"You were a beast, and you shall die as such."</font>

880
00:53:08,976 --> 00:53:11,000
<font color="#f1b178">Farewell, father.</font>

881
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:17,674
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">So, in the end it was all a lie.</font>

882
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:22,572
<font color="#f1b178">That's right. But it wasn't all for naught; 'cause I met you.</font>

883
00:53:22,573 --> 00:53:25,430
<font color="#f1b178">And with that, all the world's beauty.</font>

884
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:29,104
<font color="#f1b178">Do you hear the seagulls hovering over your head?</font>

885
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,370
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">And the sun rays shearing over the sea...</font>

886
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,636
<font color="#f1b178">And the fresh air breezing through your lungs...</font>

887
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:40,534
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">I'm proud to share these feelings with you, false King of Man.</font>

888
00:53:40,535 --> 00:53:42,575
<font color="#f1b178">Shut your mouth, piss-poor horse-herder.</font>

889
00:53:42,576 --> 00:53:44,616
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Thank you.</font>

890
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:46,657
<font color="#f1b178">No problem, brother.</font>

891
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:49,691
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Look, Ariel, the sky has opened.</font>

892
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,732
<font color="#f1b178">Unbelievable... Shall we stargaze?</font>

893
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:56,222
<font color="#f1b178">And read each other's fates, as did the Kings of old.</font>

894
00:53:56,223 --> 00:54:00,304
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Intimate, isn't it? Surely, we too will fall in love.</font>

895
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,930
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">You know, Ariel.</font>

896
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:06,604
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">In another life, this could've been my journey's end.</font>

897
00:54:06,605 --> 00:54:09,462
<font color="#f1b178">It can still be. Join me, Sal.</font>

898
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:11,911
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Where will you travel next, then?</font>

899
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:16,401
<font color="#f1b178">The Holy Land, brother. Did the stars not make that clear?</font>

900
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,850
<font color="#f1b178">Join me; let's find peace together.</font>

901
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:21,299
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Hmm... What do the stars foretell?</font>

902
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,565
<font color="#f1b178">Damned be the stars. Choose your own path!</font>

903
00:54:24,566 --> 00:54:29,055
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">But the stars are my path, Ariel, and you know that.</font>

904
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,681
<font color="#f1b178">Burning ambition and maniacal confusion.</font>

905
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,539
<font color="#f1b178">That's what I saw in your path.</font>

906
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,846
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sounds quite exciting to me. If that's my fate, then so be it.</font>

907
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:42,295
<font color="#f1b178">What a stubborn man you are.</font>

908
00:54:42,296 --> 00:54:44,336
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Don’t worry, Ariel.</font>

909
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:48,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Our fates may diverge, but this night is ours!</font>

910
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:55,878
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, by the stars, I should have known!</font>

911
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,010
<font color="#f1b178">By the charm in his forever-smile,</font>

912
00:54:58,011 --> 00:55:00,497
<font color="#f1b178">by the splendor in his stilted speech,</font>

913
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,984
<font color="#f1b178">by the shimmer in his somber eyes...</font>

914
00:55:02,985 --> 00:55:04,761
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known!</font>

915
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:08,314
<font color="#f1b178">I loved him, I loved him, I loved him dearly.</font>

916
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:11,512
<font color="#f1b178">That man with a mind serene as the stars,</font>

917
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:15,776
<font color="#f1b178">that man who dreamed to wed himself to life and its beauty.</font>

918
00:55:15,777 --> 00:55:18,971
<font color="#f1b178">I should have known, then, that he was still...</font>

919
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:22,645
<font color="#f1b178">...that bloodied cripple, who walked the meadows in mania.</font>

920
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,094
<font color="#f1b178">Cradling his kingdom from the clouds,</font>

921
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:27,952
<font color="#f1b178">to drown it in its own blood;</font>

922
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,401
<font color="#f1b178">he is rotten to the bone.</font>

923
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,483
<font color="#f1b178">I hate you, Sal. I hate every one of you.</font>

924
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:40,344
<font color="#f1b178">Mother, I am hating, forgive me.</font>

925
00:55:40,345 --> 00:55:43,202
<font color="#f1b178">My son, I am hating, hear me.</font>

926
00:55:43,203 --> 00:55:46,060
<font color="#f1b178">My daughter, I am hating, cleanse me.</font>

927
00:55:46,061 --> 00:55:49,326
<font color="#f1b178">My wife, I am hating, stand with me.</font>

928
00:55:49,327 --> 00:55:51,367
<font color="#f1b178">...</font>

929
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:54,633
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I am hating, come to me.</font>

930
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:58,715
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, I shall not hate, for I shall fight.</font>

931
00:55:58,716 --> 00:56:00,756
<font color="#f1b178">Azachon almighty, hear my prayer!</font>

932
00:56:04,169 --> 00:56:06,617
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You've finally made it, prince Ariel.</font>

933
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:08,658
<font color="#f1b178">...Greetings, venerable lady.</font>

934
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:11,924
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Oh poor thing, such stillness in your voice.</font>

935
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:16,006
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Have you seen your own eyes? How dejected, how determined.</font>

936
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:18,864
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">The journey. What did it cost you?</font>

937
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:20,905
<font color="#f1b178">Everything, venerable lady.</font>

938
00:56:20,906 --> 00:56:22,946
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Excellent. I know enough.</font>

939
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:25,395
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">You, Ariel, will be my apprentice.</font>

940
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:27,436
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Now bow.</font>

941
00:56:27,437 --> 00:56:29,477
<font color="#f1b178">Thank you, venerable lady.</font>

942
00:56:29,478 --> 00:56:31,518
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Welcome to our crusade, Ariel.</font>

943
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:36,000
<font class="speaker2" color="#428686">Death to the King. Death to his Kingdom. Hail the Azachon.</font>

944
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:43,814
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

945
00:56:43,815 --> 00:56:47,488
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

946
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:51,162
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

947
00:56:51,163 --> 00:56:54,020
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Father, we hear footsteps in the distance.</font>

948
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:56,061
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">He is here.</font>

949
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,735
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not hate, not forgive; I merely judge...</font>

950
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:03,409
<font color="#f1b178">...I do not think, not feel; I merely observe...</font>

951
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:08,090
<font color="#f1b178">My mind is a maelstrom and I see all.</font>

952
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,948
<font color="#f1b178">In this moment, I pervade every sensation.</font>

953
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:15,030
<font color="#f1b178">Be it the sensation of my body directing its dance,</font>

954
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,704
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my arm bending and bleeding,</font>

955
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,378
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of my fingers weaving their song,</font>

956
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:26,460
<font color="#f1b178">or the sensation of scorn for the beast before me.</font>

957
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:29,726
<font color="#f1b178">At the apex of obsession, all is one.</font>

958
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,767
<font color="#f1b178">This beast shall be slain.</font>

959
00:57:32,775 --> 00:57:36,040
<font color="#f1b178">Floors have shattered, the beast is pushing through.</font>

960
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:40,122
<font color="#f1b178">There is not a single emotion upon his disgusting face.</font>

961
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,571
<font color="#f1b178">Does there not linger Soeise's compassion,</font>

962
00:57:42,572 --> 00:57:45,020
<font color="#f1b178">or Roeroan's rage or Teonan's guilt,</font>

963
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:48,286
<font color="#f1b178">or the beautiful reverence once harbored by Sal?</font>

964
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,327
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">You are hating, father.</font>

965
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,368
<font color="#f1b178">Speak, devil, speak!</font>

966
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,409
<font color="#f1b178">I beg of you, speak!</font>

967
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,865
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop, father, you are hurting, hurting!</font>

968
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,906
<font color="#f1b178"><b>Speak to me, brother!</b></font>

969
00:57:59,907 --> 00:58:01,947
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Stop right now!</font>

970
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:04,805
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">Retreat at once! Do it for me!</font>

971
00:58:04,806 --> 00:58:06,846
<font color="#f1b178">I must... not...</font>

972
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,887
<font color="#f1b178">Merely...</font>

973
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,928
<font color="#f1b178">Oh Azachon... almighty...</font>

974
00:58:10,929 --> 00:58:12,969
<font class="speaker2" color="#eefc9a">...</font>

975
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,000
<font color="#f1b178">Ah... I have... failed.</font>

976
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:21,858
<font color="#467546">What was that guy going on about?</font>

977
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:23,899
<font color="#467546">Me, a "beast"? A "devil"?</font>

978
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,165
<font color="#467546">These Memories contain nothing that warrant such words.</font>

979
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:30,431
<font color="#467546">...And these memories aren't mine to begin with.</font>

980
00:58:30,432 --> 00:58:32,472
<font color="#467546">...Right?</font>

981
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:35,330
<font color="#467546">He also muttered something about the Eye.</font>

982
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:38,596
<font color="#467546">I'm simply doing what It requests of me.</font>

983
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:41,862
<font color="#467546">Doesn't that mean we're on the same side?</font>

984
00:58:41,863 --> 00:58:44,311
<font color="#467546">Then why attack me so fiercely?</font>

985
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:49,209
<font color="#467546">That fight really brought us down deep, huh.</font>

986
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:52,883
<font color="#467546">I can't even make out the ceiling any more.</font>

987
00:58:52,884 --> 00:58:58,190
<font color="#467546">This place was already ruined beyond belief, but we didn't really help matters.</font>

988
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:02,680
<font color="#467546">I hope I can still find the Memory under the rubble.</font>

989
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:09,211
<font color="#467546">Though I do feel that this fight was more informative than the Memory could ever be.</font>

990
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,477
<font color="#467546">Perhaps I should ask the Eye about this.</font>

991
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,518
<font color="#467546">...On second thought, maybe not.</font>

992
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:20,232
<font color="#467546">I thought it was because of all the fighting, but...</font>

993
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:22,273
<font color="#467546">It's <i>hot</i> down here.</font>

994
00:59:22,274 --> 00:59:25,947
<font color="#467546">So much hotter than the caverns and ruins above.</font>

995
00:59:25,948 --> 00:59:29,213
<font color="#467546">Yet, somehow, I don't really <i>feel</i> it, anymore.</font>

996
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:32,887
<font color="#467546">I feel like I'm changing the deeper I'm going.</font>

997
00:59:32,888 --> 00:59:36,561
<font color="#467546">I don't need to sleep as much anymore, either.</font>

998
00:59:36,562 --> 00:59:38,602
<font color="#467546">My appetite's also disappeared...</font>

999
00:59:38,603 --> 00:59:41,460
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">I guess that's all a good thing.</font>

1000
00:59:41,461 --> 00:59:46,358
<font class="speaker2" color="#467546">Sleep and meals in a place like this are only a bother.</font>

1001
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:50,031
<font color="#467546">This gate is humongous.</font>

1002
00:59:50,032 --> 00:59:54,521
<font color="#467546">I really hope that whatever adventure awaits on the other side...</font>

1003
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:59,000
<font color="#467546">It will be kinder to me than my journey so far.</font>

1004
00:59:59,001 --> 00:59:59,100
<font color="#467546"></font>

1005
00:59:59,101 --> 00:59:59,200
<font color="#467546"></font>

1006
00:59:59,201 --> 00:59:59,300
<font color="#467546"></font>

1007
00:59:59,301 --> 00:59:59,400
<font color="#467546"></font>

1008
00:59:59,401 --> 00:59:59,500
<font color="#467546"></font>

1009
00:59:59,501 --> 00:59:59,600
<font color="#467546"></font>

1010
00:59:59,601 --> 00:59:59,700
<font color="#467546"></font>

1011
00:59:59,701 --> 00:59:59,800
<font color="#467546"></font>

1012
00:59:59,801 --> 00:59:59,900
