    <p>I'm a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou</a> fanatic. Just a bit.</p>
    <p>Because of that, I occasionally join game jams themed around Touhou. This resulted in the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i><a href="https://atrufulgium.itch.io/flee-fairies-flee">Flee, Fairies, Flee!</a> (2019)</i>, a janky little platformer where you control two characters at once through short but overly difficult stages. No, I haven't heard of the term <em>"flow state"</em>, what are you talking about? Game design?</li>
        <li><i><a href="https://atrufulgium.itch.io/flee-fairies-flee">Youmu's Rampage</a> (2020)</i>, an infinite scroller I made with the sole purpose to understand 2d skeletal animation a bit better. It's... better than the previous one? Possible? Mayhaps?</li>
    </ul>
    I like the phrase <em>"jack of all trades"</em>; all parts (graphics, audio, programming, etc) were made by just me in the 72h timeframe. Perhaps not the brightest of ideas.
