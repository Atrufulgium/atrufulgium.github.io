*Note: Don't forget to not publish this!*

After way too many hurdles, I've finally finished my thesis, woohoo!

Ahem.

This is a post about my thesis, "*Extraction of ZX-diagrams without gflow*". While it's a thesis on quantum computing, not much will be familiar to those that work just with the circuit model! Indeed, none of those words in the title can be found in a regular textbook on quantum computing.

I'll first explain the all of those words: I'll start out explaining what ZX-diagrams are, then move on to gflow, and then sketch how gflow allows you to turn ZX-diagrams back into quantum circuits. Finally, I'll move on to my generalisation, "*glack*", and what properties it does and does not have, compared to gflow. **TODO: Better fake TOC.**

ZX-diagrams
===========
For certain kinds of optimizations, the circuit model is somewhat of a poor fit. You have all kinds of primitives to deal with when you want to rewrite your circuit: the $Z$ gate, the $X$ gate, the Hadamard-gate, the CNOT gate, the list goes on and on. When optimizing, you really want a simpler representation for circuits. You can achieve this by limiting yourself to a certain *universal gate set*, but there is not much consensus on which set to use.

The classic solution to this is to introduce *yet another* standard for people to use. The ZX-calculus is quite different from the circuit model, but just as powerful. One major advantage is that the ZX-calculus has very little primitives. In fact, there's just three:

IMAGE WITH REGULAR EDGE, H-EDGE, Z-SPIDER

As you can see, we have regular edges, weird dotted edges, and little circles with a phase in them. Let's start with the most difficult of these: the circles with a phase in them.

DEFINITION Z-SPIDER $\C^{2^n} \to \C^{2^m}$, $\ket{0\cdots0}\bra{0\cdots0} + e^{i\alpha}\ket{1\cdots1}\bra{1\cdots1}$

Unlike the circuit model's gates, these spiders represent maps that are at most rank 2. But with this variable number of inputs and outputs, you can easily implement quite some familiar structures you'll find in the circuit model.

Z GATE, $\ket\pm$ STATES, $\set{\ket\pm}$ MEASUREMENTS

If we ignore the constant factor, these are the same. As quantum computing is very unitary business, we'll ignore this constant factor if it's non-zero.

Next up, the normal wires. Just like the circuit model, these represent qubits moving around, or the identity map if you prefer. Unlike the circuit model, we're free to bend these wires however we like, without changing the meaning of the diagram. We can also connect the wires to the spiders wherever we want, swapping order, input wires, or output wires.

NORMAL EQUALS WHACK EQUALS VERY WHACK

This is somewhat surprising with how dependent on the inputs and outputs the definition of spiders is, but with the following three formal definitions, the math works out.

WIRE EQUALS IDENTITY PLUS CUP CAP SNAKE

Because of this, we'll also allow us to write vertical wires from spiders. This is not part of the original definition, but if it doesn't matter whether it's on the left- or the right side of the spider, it doesn't matter!

Our final primitive are those weird dotted edges. These simply represent a Hadamard gate being present.

WIRE WITH HADAMARD GATE

With these primitives, you have the same expressive power as the circuit model already! One problem, however, is that while we have the same expressive power as the circuit model, it's not easy to translate back to the circuit model. Sure, you could calculate the matrix that a ZX-diagram corresponds to, and synthesize that as a circuit, but that's not efficient at all.

This problem is called *circuit extraction*: is it possible to efficiently turn a ZX-diagram back into a circuit, with any ancillae? This has been well-studied already, and it's known that this is very dependent on whether a diagram has *gflow*. I will introduce this property later down the line.

ZX-calculus
===========

For gflow I need:
- Fusion
- Custom H'd $\pi$-copy
- Custom identity removal

Afterwards note that we assume all possible fusions have been done, and we work with graph-like diagrams for the remainder of the post.

Measurement-based Quantum Computing
===================================
Apart from the circuit model and ZX-diagrams, there's a third way to represent quantum algorithms: *measurement-based quantum computing*, or MBQC for short.

The idea in MBQC is simple. While in the circuit model, you're applying tons of gates to qubits with the occasional measurement, in MBQC measurements are the *only* thing you do. For this to have any effect, you need to start with a state that's highly entangled -- otherwise, measurements wouldn't affect other qubits, so you'd hardly call it computation!

So, to fully specify an algorithm, MBQC needs two things: the initial state, and the measurements. The initial state consists of only entangling operations (i.e. CZ-gates), so this can be described with a *graph state*.

IMAGE ABOUT GRAPH STATES AND THE ZX FORMULATION

Yes, we'll be using ZX to represent MBQC circuits, as it's very convenient for this task. Every spider in this state is connected only to other spiders in this state, and a *measurement effect* at the end. What measurements do we allow? The following:

$$\begin{align*}
      &\ket{\pm_{\XY,\alpha}} = \ket 0 \pm e^{i\alpha} \ket 1;
    \\&\ket{\pm_{\XZ,\alpha}} = \cos(\tfrac\alpha2)\ket0\pm\sin(\tfrac\alpha2)\ket1;
    \\&\ket{\pm_{\YZ,\alpha}} = \ket + \pm e^{i\alpha} \ket -.
\end{align*}$$

In ZX, the implementation of these three looks very simple.

MEASUREMENT BASES VS ZX MEASUREMENT EFFECTS

Here, the $a$ variable represents our measurement outcome. A value of $a=0$ is the "expected" outcome, while $a=1$ introduces an additional $\pi$ factor that we will have to correct for in other measurements. **TODO: explain corrections/measurement outcomes a bit more; note the final measurement needs no correction** Because of these corrections, order suddenly starts to matter. Consider the following simple MBQC diagram:

EQ (3.4) FROM THESIS

Both $u$ and $v$ are measured in the XY-plane, with measurement angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$. If we first correct $u$, we need to handle the $a\pi$ factor that appears, which we $\pi$-copy over. This then changes the measurement of $v$ from $\beta + b\pi$ to $(-1)^a\beta + b\pi$:

EQ (3.5) FROM THESIS

However, there is a limitation to these corrections. We may only correct vertices we have not yet measured. In some cases, this may result in diagrams which cannot be corrected at all. Consider for instance the following triangle.

EQ (3.4) BUT A TRIANGLE INSTEAD OF A LINE

Similar to before, correcting $u$ adds a $(-1)^a$ factor to both $v$ and $w$'s measurements. But if we now want to correct $v$, we must push a $(-1)^b$ factor to $u$ -- which we already measured! In effect, we have to change the past, which is not allowed. There's also no way around this. We cannot find a good *measurement order* here.

But don't give up just yet, things are about to get worse. The MBQC diagrams we considered above have no inputs or outputs.
