I apparently have a thing going on "new week, new programming language". Let's keep it up, and this week, move on to *shaders*.

I'll talk about the shader I made for [a music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FtlRY6haUI) ages ago. It is a shader that renders the scene in a wireframe mesh. However, unlike most of those shaders, I make the lines look hand-drawn.

If you don't know what any of those words mean, don't worry, I'll introduce everything you need. Buckle up, this'll be a long ride.

The code for this shader as used in the video can be found in my [pile-of-shaders](https://github.com/Atrufulgium/pile-of-shaders) repo. It will differ from the code here a little, for presentation purposes.
