    <h1>I like programming.</h1>
    <p>Not much of a surprise if you've managed to click your way into this page, but I like programming.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, many of the problems I wanna tackle have <em>at most</em> one paper written about them. I actually need to get creative? <em>Ugh.</em></p>
    <p>The problem solving's really the best part of programming, and I encounter the weirdest things in my little corner. I'll document some of those nuggets here.</p>
    <p>In case you're interested, my Github can be found <a href="https://github.com/Atrufulgium">here</a>.</p>
